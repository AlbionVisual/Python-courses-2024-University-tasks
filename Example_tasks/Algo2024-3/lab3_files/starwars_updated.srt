1
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.354
This will begin to make things right.

2
00:02:58.263 --> 00:03:01.267
I've traveled too far and seen too much

3
00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.319
to ignore the despair in the galaxy.

4
00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:08.282
Without the Jedi, there can be
no balance in the Force.

5
00:03:09.107 --> 00:03:11.656
Well, because of you,
now we have a chance.

6
00:03:11.776 --> 00:03:13.528
The General's been after this
for a long time.

7
00:03:13.987 --> 00:03:15.409
Oh, the General?

8
00:03:15.488 --> 00:03:17.866
To me, she is royalty.

9
00:03:18.283 --> 00:03:19.876
Well, she certainly is that.

10
00:03:25.707 --> 00:03:26.879
We got company.

11
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.477
You have to hide.

12
00:03:41.598 --> 00:03:43.020
You have to leave.

13
00:03:45.143 --> 00:03:46.144
Go.

14
00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.853
Come on, BB-8, hurry!

15
00:04:32.107 --> 00:04:33.233
<i>STORMTROOPER'. Blast that X-Wing!</i>

16
00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:34.488
<i>Over there! Over there!</i>

17
00:04:39.531 --> 00:04:41.625
I see them.

18
00:05:13.231 --> 00:05:14.198
You take this.

19
00:05:14.274 --> 00:05:16.242
It's safer with you than it is with me.

20
00:05:17.068 --> 00:05:19.196
You get as far away from here
as you can.

21
00:05:20.363 --> 00:05:22.081
Do you hear me?

22
00:05:22.198 --> 00:05:23.575
I'll come back for you.

23
00:05:24.242 --> 00:05:25.619
Itwill be all right.

24
00:06:24.677 --> 00:06:25.974
Keep moving!

25
00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.482
Stay here.

26
00:06:52.872 --> 00:06:55.751
<i>Look how old you've become.</i>

27
00:06:56.418 --> 00:06:59.388
Something far worse
has happened to you.

28
00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:02.173
<i>You know what I've come for.</i>

29
00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:04.472
I know where you come from.

30
00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:06.519
Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.

31
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:10.606
<i>The map to Skywalker.
We know you found it.</i>

32
00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:14.519
<i>And now you're going
to give it to the First Order.</i>

33
00:07:14.644 --> 00:07:17.113
The First Order rose from the dark side.

34
00:07:17.188 --> 00:07:18.189
You did not.

35
00:07:19.357 --> 00:07:21.860
<i>I'll show you the dark side.</i>

36
00:07:22.527 --> 00:07:24.200
You may try.

37
00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:28.284
But you cannot deny
the truth that is your family.

38
00:07:29.033 --> 00:07:30.080
<i>You're so right.</i>

39
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.408
So, who talks first?
You talk first? I talk first?

40
00:08:07.572 --> 00:08:09.449
<i>The old man gave it to you.</i>

41
00:08:09.616 --> 00:08:11.209
It's just very hard to
understand you with all the...

42
00:08:11.284 --> 00:08:12.911
- Search him.
-...apparatus.

43
00:08:16.956 --> 00:08:18.833
<i>- Nothing, sir.
- Put him on board.</i>

44
00:08:24.964 --> 00:08:27.467
<i>PHASMA". Sir, the villagers?</i>

45
00:08:30.053 --> 00:08:31.270
<i>- Kill them all.</i>

46
00:08:32.764 --> 00:08:34.357
<i>On my command.</i>

47
00:08:35.308 --> 00:08:36.685
<i>Fire.</i>

48
00:08:36.768 --> 00:08:38.770
Please, no!

49
00:09:07.257 --> 00:09:09.055
Nothing here.
Go ahead!

50
00:09:50.091 --> 00:09:51.183
All right.

51
00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:52.260
All right!

52
00:10:18.161 --> 00:10:19.879
<i>PHASMA'. FN-2187.</i>

53
00:10:20.538 --> 00:10:23.041
<i>Submit your blaster for inspection.</i>

54
00:10:23.708 --> 00:10:24.960
Yes, Captain.

55
00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:28.220
<i>And who gave you permission
to remove that helmet?</i>

56
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.881
I'm sorry, Captain.

57
00:10:29.964 --> 00:10:32.058
<i>Report to my division at once.</i>

58
00:13:17.757 --> 00:13:21.011
What you brought
me today is worth...

59
00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:22.808
hmm...

60
00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:26.854
one quarter portion.

61
00:15:24.133 --> 00:15:26.511
Shh.

62
00:15:28.554 --> 00:15:30.852
That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts.

63
00:15:31.557 --> 00:15:33.150
He has no respect for anyone.

64
00:15:36.854 --> 00:15:37.946
Your antenna's bent.

65
00:15:47.698 --> 00:15:48.745
Where do you come from?

66
00:15:52.536 --> 00:15:54.334
Classified, really?

67
00:15:54.413 --> 00:15:55.710
Me too. Big secret.

68
00:15:56.624 --> 00:15:59.719
Niima Outpost is that way.
Stay off Kelvin Ridge.

69
00:15:59.877 --> 00:16:01.675
Keep away from
the Sinking Fields in the north.

70
00:16:01.837 --> 00:16:03.259
You'll drown in the sand.

71
00:16:08.594 --> 00:16:11.473
Don't follow me. Town is that way.

72
00:16:14.684 --> 00:16:15.685
No!

73
00:16:32.076 --> 00:16:33.703
In the morning, you go.

74
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.626
You're welcome.

75
00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:53.598
<i>I had no idea we had...</i>

76
00:16:53.681 --> 00:16:56.434
<i>the best pilot in
the Resistance on board.</i>

77
00:16:58.853 --> 00:16:59.854
<i>Comfortable?</i>

78
00:17:00.438 --> 00:17:01.439
Not really.

79
00:17:02.898 --> 00:17:04.195
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

80
00:17:06.694 --> 00:17:08.412
<i>No one has been able to
get out of you...</i>

81
00:17:09.113 --> 00:17:11.992
<i>what you did with the map.</i>

82
00:17:12.491 --> 00:17:14.835
You might want to rethink
your technique.

83
00:17:30.301 --> 00:17:32.645
<i>POE GRUNTS)
- Where is it?</i>

84
00:17:34.597 --> 00:17:36.224
The Resistance...

85
00:17:36.307 --> 00:17:38.309
will not be intimidated by you.

86
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.279
<i>Where... is it?</i>

87
00:17:55.242 --> 00:17:57.995
<i>It's in a droid. A BB unit.</i>

88
00:17:58.079 --> 00:18:00.548
Well, then, if it's on Jakku,
we'll soon have it.

89
00:18:00.623 --> 00:18:02.296
<i>I leave that to you.</i>

90
00:18:04.251 --> 00:18:07.130
Don't give up hope.
He still might show up.

91
00:18:07.213 --> 00:18:09.341
Whoever it is you're waiting for.

92
00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:10.891
Classified.

93
00:18:11.592 --> 00:18:13.640
I know all about waiting.

94
00:18:15.262 --> 00:18:16.684
For my family.

95
00:18:17.348 --> 00:18:20.101
They'll be back. One day.

96
00:18:20.893 --> 00:18:21.894
Come on.

97
00:18:24.897 --> 00:18:28.071
<i>These five pieces are worth...</i>

98
00:18:28.901 --> 00:18:31.029
Let me see here... hmm...

99
00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:34.122
one half portion.

100
00:18:34.198 --> 00:18:35.916
Last week they were a half portion each.

101
00:18:36.033 --> 00:18:37.706
What about the droid?

102
00:18:40.538 --> 00:18:41.585
What about him?

103
00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:43.878
I'll pay for him.

104
00:18:49.755 --> 00:18:52.053
Sixty portions.

105
00:19:04.061 --> 00:19:05.062
Actually...

106
00:19:07.064 --> 00:19:08.987
The droid's not for sale.

107
00:19:11.318 --> 00:19:12.319
Come on.

108
00:19:16.615 --> 00:19:18.993
Follow the girl and get that droid.

109
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.298
<i>Ren wants the prisoner.</i>

110
00:19:33.674 --> 00:19:34.800
<i>FN-2187". Turn here.</i>

111
00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.761
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

112
00:19:37.845 --> 00:19:40.098
<i>If you do exactly as I say,
I can get you out of here.</i>

113
00:19:40.181 --> 00:19:41.182
What?

114
00:19:42.433 --> 00:19:44.527
This is a rescue. I'm helping you escape.

115
00:19:44.602 --> 00:19:46.354
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

116
00:19:46.437 --> 00:19:47.484
You're with the Resistance?

117
00:19:47.605 --> 00:19:49.528
What? No, no, no. I'm breaking you out.

118
00:19:49.607 --> 00:19:51.609
- Can you fly a TIE fighter?
- I can fly anything.

119
00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:54.953
Why? Why are you helping me?

120
00:19:56.322 --> 00:19:58.040
Because it's the right thing to do.

121
00:19:58.949 --> 00:19:59.996
You need a pilot.

122
00:20:00.117 --> 00:20:01.460
I need a pilot.

123
00:20:02.953 --> 00:20:04.045
We're gonna do this.

124
00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:05.372
Yeah?

125
00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:11.887
<i>Okay. Stay calm. Stay calm.</i>

126
00:20:11.962 --> 00:20:14.465
- I <i>am calm.
- I'm talking to myself.</i>

127
00:20:16.967 --> 00:20:17.968
<i>Not yet.</i>

128
00:20:19.845 --> 00:20:21.563
<i>Okay, go. This way.</i>

129
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:29.905
I've always wanted to fly
one of these things.

130
00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.074
- Can you shoot?
- Blasters, I can.

131
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:33.492
Okay, same principle.

132
00:20:33.567 --> 00:20:34.568
Use the toggle on the left...

133
00:20:34.652 --> 00:20:36.325
to switch between missiles,
cannons and mag pulse.

134
00:20:36.445 --> 00:20:37.867
Use the sight on the right to aim.

135
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.078
- Triggers to fire.
- This is very complicated.

136
00:20:46.664 --> 00:20:47.756
I can fix this.

137
00:20:51.085 --> 00:20:53.588
We have an unsanctioned
departure from bay two.

138
00:20:53.671 --> 00:20:56.424
Alert General Hux. And stop that fighter.

139
00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:18.203
Fourteen failed. Eighteen...

140
00:21:20.281 --> 00:21:21.373
<i>I</i> got it.

141
00:21:25.286 --> 00:21:26.833
This thing really moves.

142
00:21:31.417 --> 00:21:33.590
We gotta take out as many of
these cannons as we can...

143
00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:34.799
or we're not gonna get very far.

144
00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:36.300
- All right.
- I'm gonna get us in position.

145
00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.381
Just stay sharp.

146
00:21:40.592 --> 00:21:42.185
Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it?

147
00:21:42.261 --> 00:21:43.308
I got us dead center.

148
00:21:43.387 --> 00:21:44.513
-It's a clean shot.
- Okay, got it.

149
00:21:53.272 --> 00:21:54.694
- Yeah!
- Yes!

150
00:21:54.773 --> 00:21:55.865
Did you see that?

151
00:21:55.941 --> 00:21:57.568
- Did you see that?
- I saw it!

152
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.366
Hey, what's your name?

153
00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:05.702
FN-2187.

154
00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:07.001
F... What?

155
00:22:07.077 --> 00:22:08.920
That's the only name they ever gave me.

156
00:22:09.038 --> 00:22:11.507
Well, I ain't using it. F-N, huh?

157
00:22:11.582 --> 00:22:13.084
Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn.

158
00:22:13.167 --> 00:22:14.794
- Is that all right?
- Finn.

159
00:22:14.877 --> 00:22:16.550
Yeah. Finn, I like that.

160
00:22:16.628 --> 00:22:18.801
- I like that.
- I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.

161
00:22:18.881 --> 00:22:20.804
- Good to meet you, Poe.
- Good to meet you too, Finn.

162
00:22:24.386 --> 00:22:26.809
Sir, they've
taken out our turbolasers.

163
00:22:27.598 --> 00:22:28.975
Use the ventral cannons.

164
00:22:29.308 --> 00:22:31.231
Yes, sir. Bringing them online.

165
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:34.029
<i>KYLO REN". General Hux,
is it the Resistance pilot?</i>

166
00:22:34.104 --> 00:22:36.527
Yes, and he had help...

167
00:22:36.607 --> 00:22:37.984
from one of our own.

168
00:22:38.776 --> 00:22:39.993
We're checking the registers now...

169
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.987
to identify which stormtrooper it was.

170
00:22:42.112 --> 00:22:45.491
<i>The one from the village. FN-2187.</i>

171
00:22:46.116 --> 00:22:47.914
Sir, ventral cannons hot.

172
00:22:48.452 --> 00:22:49.453
Fire.

173
00:22:58.837 --> 00:23:00.510
One's coming toward you!
My right. Your left.

174
00:23:00.589 --> 00:23:02.341
- Do you see it?
- Hold on.

175
00:23:02.466 --> 00:23:03.467
I see him!

176
00:23:06.845 --> 00:23:08.347
Nice shot!

177
00:23:14.686 --> 00:23:15.778
Where are we going?

178
00:23:15.896 --> 00:23:17.022
We're going back to Jakku.
That's where.

179
00:23:17.147 --> 00:23:18.694
No. We can't go back to Jakku.

180
00:23:18.774 --> 00:23:20.242
We need to get out of this system.

181
00:23:20.317 --> 00:23:22.194
I gotta get my droid
before the First Order does.

182
00:23:22.319 --> 00:23:23.571
- What, a droid?
- That's right.

183
00:23:23.654 --> 00:23:25.873
He's a BB unit, orange and
white. One of a kind.

184
00:23:25.989 --> 00:23:26.990
I don't care what color he is!

185
00:23:27.074 --> 00:23:28.326
No droid can be that important.

186
00:23:28.409 --> 00:23:29.410
This one is, pal!

187
00:23:29.493 --> 00:23:31.166
We gotta get as far away from
the First Order as we can.

188
00:23:31.286 --> 00:23:32.583
We go back to Jakku, we die.

189
00:23:32.663 --> 00:23:35.382
That droid has a map
that leads straight to Luke Skywalker.

190
00:23:35.457 --> 00:23:37.380
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

191
00:23:40.462 --> 00:23:43.557
<i>FN-2187 reported
to my division...</i>

192
00:23:43.674 --> 00:23:45.972
<i>was evaluated,
and sent to reconditioning.</i>

193
00:23:46.051 --> 00:23:48.304
No prior signs of nonconformity?

194
00:23:48.387 --> 00:23:50.310
<i>This was his first offense.</i>

195
00:23:50.389 --> 00:23:51.515
General!

196
00:23:51.598 --> 00:23:52.975
- They've been hit.
- Destroyed?

197
00:23:53.058 --> 00:23:54.310
Disabled.

198
00:23:54.393 --> 00:23:55.815
They were headed back to Jakku.

199
00:23:55.894 --> 00:23:58.113
The fighter is projected to
crash in the Goazon badlands.

200
00:23:58.188 --> 00:23:59.861
They were going back for the droid.

201
00:23:59.982 --> 00:24:01.905
Send a squad to the wreckage.

202
00:24:24.256 --> 00:24:25.428
Poe!

203
00:24:26.758 --> 00:24:28.055
POeI

204
00:24:28.886 --> 00:24:29.933
POeI

205
00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:34.892
Poe! I got you.

206
00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.061
POeI

207
00:24:44.902 --> 00:24:45.949
POeI

208
00:26:10.153 --> 00:26:12.372
<i>Supreme Leader Snoke
was explicit.</i>

209
00:26:12.531 --> 00:26:14.954
Capture the droid if we can,
but destroy it if we must.

210
00:26:15.033 --> 00:26:16.831
<i>KYLO REN". How capable
are your soldiers, General?</i>

211
00:26:16.952 --> 00:26:18.420
I won't have you question my methods.

212
00:26:18.495 --> 00:26:20.543
<i>They're obviously skilled
at committing high treason.</i>

213
00:26:20.664 --> 00:26:23.463
<i>Perhaps Leader Snoke should
consider using a clone army.</i>

214
00:26:23.584 --> 00:26:24.631
My men are exceptionally trained.

215
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:25.927
Programmed from birth.

216
00:26:26.003 --> 00:26:28.301
<i>Then they should have
no problem retrieving the droid.</i>

217
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.381
<i>Unharmed.</i>

218
00:26:30.465 --> 00:26:32.638
Careful, Ren, that your
personal interests...

219
00:26:32.718 --> 00:26:35.187
not interfere with orders
from Leader Snoke.

220
00:26:35.345 --> 00:26:37.768
<i>I want that map.</i>

221
00:26:37.848 --> 00:26:39.225
<i>For your sake...</i>

222
00:26:39.349 --> 00:26:40.566
<i>I suggest you get it.</i>

223
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:48.321
Water. Water.

224
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.447
No water.

225
00:26:49.526 --> 00:26:51.028
Water.

226
00:26:52.904 --> 00:26:53.996
ls there water?

227
00:27:22.434 --> 00:27:24.778
What? Oi, get off him!

228
00:27:34.237 --> 00:27:35.238
Hey!

229
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.678
They work for Unkar.

230
00:27:53.799 --> 00:27:55.551
That guy that wanted you.

231
00:27:55.634 --> 00:27:57.261
He must have really wanted you.

232
00:27:59.638 --> 00:28:01.515
REYI Who?

233
00:28:02.432 --> 00:28:04.605
Him?

234
00:28:23.412 --> 00:28:26.586
- What's your hurry, thief?
- What? Thief?

235
00:28:26.748 --> 00:28:28.216
- Ow!

236
00:28:28.291 --> 00:28:29.588
- Hey, what?
- The jacket.

237
00:28:29.668 --> 00:28:31.170
This droid says you stole it.

238
00:28:32.129 --> 00:28:33.802
I've had a pretty messed up
day, all right?

239
00:28:33.922 --> 00:28:35.014
So I'd appreciate it...

240
00:28:35.132 --> 00:28:36.349
if you stop accusing me of...

241
00:28:36.466 --> 00:28:38.889
- Ow! Stop it!
- Where'd you get it?

242
00:28:38.969 --> 00:28:40.312
It belongs to his master.

243
00:28:43.598 --> 00:28:46.693
It belonged to Poe Dameron.
That was his name, right?

244
00:28:48.729 --> 00:28:51.357
He was captured by the First Order.

245
00:28:51.481 --> 00:28:54.075
I helped him escape,
but our ship crashed.

246
00:28:57.195 --> 00:28:58.321
Poe didn't make it.

247
00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.333
I tried to help him. I'm sorry.

248
00:29:13.503 --> 00:29:15.221
So you're with the Resistance?

249
00:29:19.843 --> 00:29:21.186
Obviously.

250
00:29:21.344 --> 00:29:22.641
Yes, I am.

251
00:29:22.721 --> 00:29:24.018
I'm with the Resistance, yeah.

252
00:29:24.139 --> 00:29:26.187
I am with the Resistance.

253
00:29:27.392 --> 00:29:29.815
I've never met
a Resistance fighter before.

254
00:29:31.354 --> 00:29:32.822
Well, this is what we look like.

255
00:29:32.898 --> 00:29:35.447
Some of us. Others look different.

256
00:29:35.525 --> 00:29:36.993
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission.

257
00:29:37.068 --> 00:29:38.570
He has to get back to your base.

258
00:29:38.695 --> 00:29:40.948
Apparently, he has a map that
leads to Luke Skywalker...

259
00:29:41.031 --> 00:29:42.704
and everyone's after it.

260
00:29:43.325 --> 00:29:45.043
Luke Skywalker?

261
00:29:45.577 --> 00:29:47.079
I thought he was a myth.

262
00:29:47.287 --> 00:29:49.381
What?

263
00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.927
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

264
00:30:00.217 --> 00:30:01.389
Come on, BB-8!

265
00:30:04.721 --> 00:30:06.223
- Let go of me!
- Come on, we gotta move!

266
00:30:06.348 --> 00:30:08.442
I know how to run
without you holding my hand!

267
00:30:11.019 --> 00:30:12.817
BB-8, stay close!

268
00:30:12.896 --> 00:30:13.897
This way.

269
00:30:19.694 --> 00:30:20.911
<i>Call in the air strike.</i>

270
00:30:21.738 --> 00:30:23.285
Come on!

271
00:30:24.741 --> 00:30:25.958
They're shooting at both of us.

272
00:30:26.076 --> 00:30:27.953
Yeah. They saw you with me.
You're marked.

273
00:30:28.078 --> 00:30:29.500
- Well, thanks for that.
- Hey!

274
00:30:29.579 --> 00:30:31.422
I'm not the one who chased
you down with a stick.

275
00:30:32.707 --> 00:30:34.209
Does anyone have
blasters around here?

276
00:30:34.292 --> 00:30:35.839
Are you okay?

277
00:30:41.383 --> 00:30:42.805
Stop taking my hand!

278
00:30:59.109 --> 00:31:00.110
Hey-

279
00:31:03.405 --> 00:31:04.452
Are you okay?

280
00:31:06.449 --> 00:31:07.450
Yeah.

281
00:31:08.118 --> 00:31:09.244
Follow me.

282
00:31:20.797 --> 00:31:22.049
- We can't outrun them!
- We might...

283
00:31:22.132 --> 00:31:23.429
in that quadjumper!

284
00:31:23.508 --> 00:31:24.851
Hey, we need a pilot!

285
00:31:24.968 --> 00:31:26.515
We've got one.

286
00:31:26.636 --> 00:31:27.637
You?

287
00:31:28.305 --> 00:31:30.273
Uh, what about that ship?

288
00:31:30.348 --> 00:31:31.816
That one's garbage!

289
00:31:37.314 --> 00:31:38.782
The garbage will do.

290
00:31:54.664 --> 00:31:56.382
Gunner position is down there!

291
00:31:59.628 --> 00:32:01.255
You ever fly this thing?

292
00:32:01.379 --> 00:32:04.508
No! This ship hasn't flown in years.

293
00:32:04.674 --> 00:32:05.675
Great.

294
00:32:09.888 --> 00:32:11.105
Whoa.

295
00:32:11.723 --> 00:32:13.316
I can do this. I can do this.

296
00:32:13.725 --> 00:32:15.352
I can do this. I can do this.

297
00:32:36.539 --> 00:32:37.540
Hey!

298
00:32:41.878 --> 00:32:43.425
That's mine!

299
00:32:47.008 --> 00:32:48.601
Wait, stay low! Hey, stay low!

300
00:32:48.718 --> 00:32:49.810
- What?
- Stay <i>low!</i>

301
00:32:49.886 --> 00:32:51.103
It confuses their tracking.

302
00:32:51.471 --> 00:32:53.394
BB-8, hold on!

303
00:32:53.556 --> 00:32:54.933
I'm going low!

304
00:33:13.576 --> 00:33:14.793
What are you doing back there?

305
00:33:14.911 --> 00:33:16.083
Are you ever gonna fire back?

306
00:33:16.246 --> 00:33:18.294
I'm working on it! Are the shields up?

307
00:33:18.415 --> 00:33:20.088
Not so easy without a co-pilot!

308
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.127
Try sitting in this thing.

309
00:33:36.433 --> 00:33:37.776
We need cover, quick!

310
00:33:37.934 --> 00:33:39.231
We're about to get some!

311
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:40.527
<i>I</i> hope.

312
00:34:06.212 --> 00:34:07.714
Damn it!

313
00:34:18.683 --> 00:34:20.481
Come on, come on!

314
00:34:23.313 --> 00:34:25.566
- Nice shot!
- I'm getting pretty good at this.

315
00:34:39.579 --> 00:34:41.206
Uh, the cannon's stuck
in forward position.

316
00:34:41.289 --> 00:34:42.962
I can't move it. You gotta lose him!

317
00:34:46.836 --> 00:34:49.339
- Get ready!
- Okay. For what?

318
00:35:03.144 --> 00:35:04.270
Are we really doing this?

319
00:35:13.696 --> 00:35:15.039
Oh, no.

320
00:35:36.469 --> 00:35:37.470
Whoo!

321
00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.362
- Nice shooting.
- Now that was some flying.

322
00:35:53.444 --> 00:35:54.445
- Thanks.
- How did you do that?

323
00:35:54.529 --> 00:35:55.826
- I don't know.
- No one trained you?

324
00:35:55.905 --> 00:35:57.657
I've flown some ships, but
I've never left the planet.

325
00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:58.912
- Your last shot was dead-on.
- That was amazing.

326
00:35:58.992 --> 00:36:00.335
- You got him with one blast!
- You set me up for it.

327
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:01.787
- It was perfect.
- That was pretty good.

328
00:36:05.415 --> 00:36:07.417
You're okay. He's with the Resistance.

329
00:36:08.793 --> 00:36:10.420
He's gonna get you home.

330
00:36:11.546 --> 00:36:12.547
We both will.

331
00:36:18.386 --> 00:36:19.512
I don't know your name.

332
00:36:21.472 --> 00:36:23.019
Finn. What's yours?

333
00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:25.606
I'm Rey.

334
00:36:30.148 --> 00:36:31.491
Rey...

335
00:36:32.108 --> 00:36:34.406
Help me with this. Quick!

336
00:36:34.485 --> 00:36:35.862
Whoa, what's going on?

337
00:36:47.123 --> 00:36:48.295
Sir...

338
00:36:48.374 --> 00:36:51.002
we were unable to acquire
the droid on Jakku.

339
00:36:53.463 --> 00:36:54.635
It escaped capture...

340
00:36:54.714 --> 00:36:57.308
aboard a stolen
Corellian YT model freighter.

341
00:36:58.843 --> 00:37:00.937
<i>The droid...</i>

342
00:37:01.012 --> 00:37:02.639
<i>stole a freighter?</i>

343
00:37:02.764 --> 00:37:04.141
Not exactly, sir.

344
00:37:04.807 --> 00:37:05.808
It had help.

345
00:37:09.437 --> 00:37:10.529
We have no confirmation...

346
00:37:10.647 --> 00:37:13.025
but we believe FN-2187 may
have helped in the escape.

347
00:37:31.376 --> 00:37:32.377
<i>Anything else?</i>

348
00:37:35.255 --> 00:37:36.677
The two were accompanied by a girl.

349
00:37:42.095 --> 00:37:43.847
<i>What girl?</i>

350
00:37:46.557 --> 00:37:47.649
It's the motivator.

351
00:37:47.725 --> 00:37:49.227
Grab me a Harris wrench,
check in there.

352
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:50.311
How bad is it?

353
00:37:50.395 --> 00:37:52.068
If we wanna live, not good.

354
00:37:52.188 --> 00:37:53.155
They're hunting for us now.

355
00:37:53.231 --> 00:37:54.403
We've gotta get out of this system!

356
00:37:54.524 --> 00:37:56.026
BB-8 said the location
of the Resistance base...

357
00:37:56.192 --> 00:37:57.239
is "need to know".

358
00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:58.987
If I'm taking you there, I need to know!

359
00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:00.071
This?

360
00:38:01.322 --> 00:38:02.949
You gotta tell us
where your base is.

361
00:38:03.074 --> 00:38:05.668
I don't speak that.

362
00:38:05.743 --> 00:38:07.495
All right, between us...

363
00:38:07.578 --> 00:38:09.046
I'm not with the Resistance, okay?

364
00:38:10.039 --> 00:38:11.632
I'm just trying to get away
from the First Order.

365
00:38:11.708 --> 00:38:13.460
But you tell us where the base is...

366
00:38:13.543 --> 00:38:14.965
I'll get you there first. Deal?

367
00:38:16.045 --> 00:38:18.548
- Droid, please!
- Pilex driver, hurry.

368
00:38:18.673 --> 00:38:21.301
- So, where's your base?
- Go on, BB-8, tell her.

369
00:38:24.512 --> 00:38:25.513
Please.

370
00:38:27.557 --> 00:38:29.434
- The lleenium system?
- Yeah, the lleenium system.

371
00:38:29.559 --> 00:38:31.186
That's the one. Get us there
as fast as you can.

372
00:38:31.561 --> 00:38:32.904
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.

373
00:38:33.062 --> 00:38:34.154
I need the bonding tape, hurry!

374
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.322
What about you?

375
00:38:35.398 --> 00:38:36.615
I gotta get back to Jakku.

376
00:38:36.733 --> 00:38:37.700
Back to Jak...

377
00:38:37.775 --> 00:38:39.243
Why does everyone
wanna go back to Jakku?

378
00:38:39.319 --> 00:38:41.913
-It's not that one. No. No.
- That place is...

379
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:43.907
The one I'm pointing to. No.

380
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:45.287
No. No!

381
00:38:45.408 --> 00:38:46.751
If we don't patch it up...

382
00:38:46.909 --> 00:38:47.956
the propulsion tank will overflow...

383
00:38:48.036 --> 00:38:49.709
and flood the ship with poisonous gas!

384
00:38:49.787 --> 00:38:50.788
- This?
- Yes.

385
00:38:52.165 --> 00:38:55.009
Hey, Rey, you're a pilot.

386
00:38:55.084 --> 00:38:57.007
You can fly anywhere. Why go back?

387
00:38:57.086 --> 00:38:58.383
You got a family?

388
00:38:58.463 --> 00:38:59.589
You got a boyfriend? A cute boyfriend?

389
00:38:59.714 --> 00:39:01.182
None of your business, that's why.

390
00:39:03.593 --> 00:39:04.970
- That can't be good.
- No, it can't be.

391
00:39:10.933 --> 00:39:11.934
Someone's locked on to us.

392
00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.607
All controls are overridden.

393
00:39:20.401 --> 00:39:22.119
Get off! Get off!

394
00:39:23.863 --> 00:39:24.864
See anything?

395
00:39:26.324 --> 00:39:27.325
Oh, no.

396
00:39:35.583 --> 00:39:36.584
It's the First Order.

397
00:39:36.667 --> 00:39:38.465
What do we do?
There must be something.

398
00:39:39.253 --> 00:39:40.926
- You said poisonous gas.
- I fixed that.

399
00:39:41.005 --> 00:39:42.006
Can you unfix it?

400
00:39:47.804 --> 00:39:48.805
Come on, BB-8.

401
00:39:49.555 --> 00:39:51.432
I got him.

402
00:39:52.767 --> 00:39:54.519
I'm okay.

403
00:39:55.353 --> 00:39:56.900
BB-8, get off me!

404
00:39:59.774 --> 00:40:01.447
Do you think this will work
on the stormtroopers?

405
00:40:01.526 --> 00:40:04.075
Yeah. Their masks filter out
smoke, not toxins.

406
00:40:11.452 --> 00:40:12.624
- Hurry.
- I'm hurrying.

407
00:40:24.715 --> 00:40:27.138
Chewie...

408
00:40:27.218 --> 00:40:28.470
we're home.

409
00:40:44.485 --> 00:40:45.657
Where are the others?

410
00:40:45.736 --> 00:40:47.329
- Where's the pilot?
- I'm the <i>pilot.</i>

411
00:40:47.405 --> 00:40:48.873
You?

412
00:40:48.948 --> 00:40:50.916
<i>No, it's true.
We're the only ones on board.</i>

413
00:40:50.992 --> 00:40:52.414
<i>You can understand that thing?</i>

414
00:40:52.535 --> 00:40:53.661
And "that thing"
can understand you, too...

415
00:40:53.744 --> 00:40:54.791
so watch it.

416
00:40:54.871 --> 00:40:56.794
Come on out of there.

417
00:40:57.498 --> 00:40:59.375
- Where'd you get this ship?
- Niima Outpost.

418
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:02.049
Jakku? Thatjunkyard?

419
00:41:02.128 --> 00:41:03.345
Thank you! Junkyard.

420
00:41:03.421 --> 00:41:05.515
Told you we should have
double-checked the Western Reaches.

421
00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:07.342
Who had it? Ducain?

422
00:41:07.425 --> 00:41:09.268
I stole it. From Unkar Plutt.

423
00:41:09.343 --> 00:41:11.562
He stole it from the Irving Boys,
who stole it from Ducain.

424
00:41:11.679 --> 00:41:13.977
Who stole it from me!

425
00:41:14.056 --> 00:41:15.478
Well, you tell him that Han Solo...

426
00:41:15.558 --> 00:41:17.936
just stole back the
Millennium Falcon for good.

427
00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.939
<i>This</i> is <i>the Millennium Falcon?
You're Han Solo?</i>

428
00:41:22.565 --> 00:41:24.112
I used to be.

429
00:41:24.775 --> 00:41:26.243
Han Solo, the Rebellion general?

430
00:41:26.319 --> 00:41:27.696
No, the smuggler.

431
00:41:27.778 --> 00:41:29.621
Wasn't he a war hero?

432
00:41:29.697 --> 00:41:33.042
This is the ship that made
the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs?

433
00:41:33.117 --> 00:41:34.369
Twelve!

434
00:41:35.453 --> 00:41:36.921
Fourteen.

435
00:41:52.261 --> 00:41:53.433
Hey!

436
00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:56.934
Some moof-milker
put a compressor on the ignition line.

437
00:41:57.016 --> 00:41:58.108
Unkar Plutt did.

438
00:41:58.184 --> 00:41:59.561
I thought it was a mistake,
too. Puts too much...

439
00:41:59.644 --> 00:42:01.942
...stress on the hyperdrive.

440
00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.448
Chewie, throw them in a pod.

441
00:42:04.565 --> 00:42:06.442
We'll drop them at the
nearest inhabited planet.

442
00:42:06.526 --> 00:42:08.244
Wait, no.

443
00:42:08.319 --> 00:42:10.742
- We need your help.
- My help?

444
00:42:10.821 --> 00:42:12.368
This droid has to get
to the Resistance base...

445
00:42:12.448 --> 00:42:13.745
as soon as possible.

446
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.828
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.

447
00:42:21.332 --> 00:42:24.256
You are the Han Solo that
fought with the Rebellion.

448
00:42:30.341 --> 00:42:31.342
You knew him.

449
00:42:34.679 --> 00:42:37.808
Yeah. I knew him.

450
00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:39.517
I knew Luke.

451
00:42:42.311 --> 00:42:44.609
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.

452
00:42:45.273 --> 00:42:46.274
Wait, what?

453
00:42:47.191 --> 00:42:48.864
Did you just say Rathtars?

454
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:50.611
Hey!

455
00:42:50.695 --> 00:42:53.244
You're not hauling Rathtars
on this freighter, are you?

456
00:42:53.781 --> 00:42:56.000
I'm hauling Rathtars.

457
00:42:56.075 --> 00:42:59.295
Oh, great. It's the Guavian Death Gang.

458
00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:00.838
Must have tracked us from Nantoon.

459
00:43:00.955 --> 00:43:02.753
What's a Rathtar?

460
00:43:02.832 --> 00:43:04.334
They're big and they're dangerous.

461
00:43:04.417 --> 00:43:05.964
You ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?

462
00:43:06.043 --> 00:43:07.090
- No.
- Good.

463
00:43:07.169 --> 00:43:09.046
I got three of them going to King Prana.

464
00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:11.474
Three? How'd you get them on board?

465
00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:13.267
I used to have a bigger crew.

466
00:43:16.846 --> 00:43:18.769
Get below and stay there
until I say so...

467
00:43:18.848 --> 00:43:20.441
and don't even think about
taking the Falcon.

468
00:43:20.516 --> 00:43:21.517
What about BB-8?

469
00:43:21.601 --> 00:43:23.319
He stays with me
until I get rid of the gang...

470
00:43:23.394 --> 00:43:24.941
then you can have him back
and be on your way.

471
00:43:25.021 --> 00:43:26.989
What about the Rathtars?
Where are you keeping them?

472
00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.448
- There's one.
- What are you gonna do?

473
00:43:31.527 --> 00:43:33.825
Same thing I always do.
Talk my way out of it.

474
00:43:35.156 --> 00:43:37.409
Yes, I do. Every time.

475
00:43:54.675 --> 00:43:56.677
Han Solo.

476
00:43:56.761 --> 00:43:58.229
You're a dead man.

477
00:43:58.346 --> 00:44:01.065
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

478
00:44:01.265 --> 00:44:03.939
The problem is we loaned you
50,000 for this job.

479
00:44:04.101 --> 00:44:06.570
- Can you see them?
- No.

480
00:44:06.729 --> 00:44:09.733
I heard you also borrowed
50,000 from Kanjiklub.

481
00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.068
You know you can't trust
those little freaks.

482
00:44:12.735 --> 00:44:15.158
How long we known each other?

483
00:44:15.237 --> 00:44:16.329
They have blasters.

484
00:44:16.405 --> 00:44:17.497
A lot of them.

485
00:44:17.573 --> 00:44:20.793
Not long.
We want our money back now.

486
00:44:20.868 --> 00:44:22.870
You think hunting
Rathtars is cheap?

487
00:44:22.953 --> 00:44:24.125
I spent that money.

488
00:44:24.205 --> 00:44:26.628
Kanjiklub wants
their investment back, too.

489
00:44:26.749 --> 00:44:29.047
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

490
00:44:29.126 --> 00:44:31.003
BALA-TIKZ Tell that t0 Kanjiklub.

491
00:44:40.304 --> 00:44:42.523
Tasu Leech.

492
00:44:42.598 --> 00:44:43.599
Good to see you.

493
00:44:52.441 --> 00:44:55.445
Boys, you're both gonna
get what I promised.

494
00:44:55.528 --> 00:44:56.905
Have I ever not delivered...

495
00:44:56.987 --> 00:44:58.489
-for you before?
- Yeah.

496
00:45:02.785 --> 00:45:05.789
- What was the second time?
- Your game is old.

497
00:45:05.913 --> 00:45:08.416
There's no one in the galaxy
left for you to swindle.

498
00:45:11.085 --> 00:45:12.086
That BB unit.

499
00:45:12.169 --> 00:45:15.013
The First Order is looking
for one just like it.

500
00:45:18.509 --> 00:45:19.806
And two fugitives.

501
00:45:23.681 --> 00:45:24.807
First I've heard of it.

502
00:45:30.646 --> 00:45:31.818
Wait, wait, wait.

503
00:45:34.984 --> 00:45:37.032
If we close the blast doors
in that corridor...

504
00:45:37.153 --> 00:45:38.279
we can trap both gangs!

505
00:45:38.362 --> 00:45:39.830
We'll close the blast doors from here?

506
00:45:39.905 --> 00:45:41.703
Resetting the fuses should do it.

507
00:45:49.665 --> 00:45:51.463
I got a bad feeling about this.

508
00:45:51.542 --> 00:45:53.670
- Oh, no.
-"Oh, no," what?

509
00:45:54.628 --> 00:45:55.629
Wrong fuses.

510
00:45:55.713 --> 00:45:56.885
Kill them!

511
00:45:57.006 --> 00:45:58.223
- Whoa...
- And take the droid!

512
00:46:24.033 --> 00:46:25.876
- This was a mistake!
- Huge!

513
00:46:39.089 --> 00:46:40.090
What do they look like?

514
00:46:46.055 --> 00:46:48.057
They look like that.

515
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:52.152
- This way.
- Are you sure?

516
00:46:54.063 --> 00:46:55.235
No,no,no!

517
00:46:56.273 --> 00:46:57.650
Finn!

518
00:46:58.651 --> 00:46:59.743
Finn!

519
00:47:00.903 --> 00:47:01.904
Rey!

520
00:47:05.074 --> 00:47:06.371
Get Off! Get Off!

521
00:47:11.789 --> 00:47:14.133
- Rey!
- Finn!

522
00:47:15.334 --> 00:47:16.426
Finn!

523
00:47:17.086 --> 00:47:18.759
<i>Get</i> off me!

524
00:47:30.432 --> 00:47:31.934
FIN NI <i>Rey!</i>

525
00:47:34.979 --> 00:47:37.858
Get off! Get off!

526
00:47:40.276 --> 00:47:41.778
Finn!

527
00:47:42.444 --> 00:47:44.788
- It had me! But the door...
- That was lucky.

528
00:47:48.826 --> 00:47:51.124
I got the door. Cover us!

529
00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.837
Chewie!

530
00:48:02.715 --> 00:48:04.308
You okay?

531
00:48:05.467 --> 00:48:06.468
Wow.

532
00:48:08.679 --> 00:48:10.898
Come on! Come on!

533
00:48:14.643 --> 00:48:15.644
Han.

534
00:48:15.728 --> 00:48:17.981
You, close the door behind us.
You, take care of Chewie!

535
00:48:25.654 --> 00:48:26.906
Hey, where are you going?

536
00:48:26.989 --> 00:48:28.662
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump, too.

537
00:48:28.741 --> 00:48:30.539
If we don't prime that,
we're not going anywhere.

538
00:48:30.659 --> 00:48:31.831
I hate that guy.

539
00:48:31.952 --> 00:48:34.455
- And you could use a co-pilot.
- I got one, he's back there.

540
00:48:36.916 --> 00:48:38.884
Watch the thrust. We're going
out of here at lightspeed.

541
00:48:39.001 --> 00:48:40.799
From inside the hangar?
Is that even possible?

542
00:48:40.878 --> 00:48:43.131
I never ask that question
till after I've done it.

543
00:48:43.213 --> 00:48:45.011
<i>RAT HT AR GROW LS)
{REY YELP S';</i>

544
00:48:45.382 --> 00:48:47.510
This is not how I thought
this day was gonna go.

545
00:48:47.635 --> 00:48:49.603
Angle the shield. Hang on back there.

546
00:48:49.678 --> 00:48:50.850
No problem!

547
00:49:00.773 --> 00:49:02.025
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

548
00:49:04.568 --> 00:49:06.536
- What?
- Compressor.

549
00:49:15.037 --> 00:49:16.254
Inform the First Order...

550
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:18.173
that Han Solo has the droid they want.

551
00:49:18.248 --> 00:49:20.250
<i>And it's</i> aboard <i>the Millennium Falcon.</i>

552
00:49:29.176 --> 00:49:33.556
<i>The droid will soon be
delivered to the Resistance...</i>

553
00:49:34.765 --> 00:49:38.565
leading them to the last Jedi.

554
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:43.525
If Skywalker returns...

555
00:49:44.066 --> 00:49:48.071
the new Jedi will rise.

556
00:49:49.238 --> 00:49:50.785
Supreme Leader,
I take full responsibility...

557
00:49:50.906 --> 00:49:52.579
General!

558
00:49:54.785 --> 00:49:57.584
Our strategy must now change.

559
00:49:57.705 --> 00:49:59.753
The weapon. It is ready.

560
00:49:59.873 --> 00:50:02.126
I believe the time has come to use it.

561
00:50:02.251 --> 00:50:03.548
We shall destroy the government...

562
00:50:03.627 --> 00:50:05.049
that supports the Resistance...

563
00:50:05.129 --> 00:50:06.847
the Republic.

564
00:50:06.922 --> 00:50:08.469
Without their friends to protect them...

565
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:10.142
the Resistance will be vulnerable.

566
00:50:10.384 --> 00:50:13.308
And we will stop them
before they reach Skywalker.

567
00:50:13.387 --> 00:50:14.639
Go.

568
00:50:15.431 --> 00:50:16.853
Oversee preparations.

569
00:50:16.932 --> 00:50:18.605
Yes, Supreme Leader.

570
00:50:24.565 --> 00:50:25.942
There has been an awakening.

571
00:50:27.651 --> 00:50:29.403
Have you felt it?

572
00:50:30.946 --> 00:50:31.993
Yes.

573
00:50:33.365 --> 00:50:34.992
There's something more.

574
00:50:36.535 --> 00:50:40.711
<i>The</i> droid <i>we</i> seek <i>is</i> aboard
<i>the Millennium Falcon.</i>

575
00:50:41.498 --> 00:50:44.377
In the hands of your father...

576
00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:48.306
Han Solo.

577
00:50:50.924 --> 00:50:53.302
<i>He means nothing to me.</i>

578
00:50:53.427 --> 00:50:58.228
Even you, master of the
Knights of Ren...

579
00:50:58.849 --> 00:51:02.319
have never faced such a test.

580
00:51:02.936 --> 00:51:06.156
<i>By the grace of your training,
I will not be seduced.</i>

581
00:51:07.274 --> 00:51:09.117
We shall see.

582
00:51:11.695 --> 00:51:13.538
We shall see.

583
00:51:21.622 --> 00:51:23.841
- Electrical overload.
- I can fix that.

584
00:51:23.957 --> 00:51:25.209
Coolant's leaking.

585
00:51:26.543 --> 00:51:27.795
Try transferring auxiliary power...

586
00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:29.297
...to the secondary tank.

587
00:51:29.379 --> 00:51:30.926
I got it.

588
00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:32.717
Chewie, come on!

589
00:51:34.343 --> 00:51:35.936
I need help with this giant hairy thing!

590
00:51:36.011 --> 00:51:37.012
Stop moving!

591
00:51:39.056 --> 00:51:40.854
FINNI Chewie!

592
00:51:40.974 --> 00:51:42.692
You hurt Chewie,
you're gonna deal with me!

593
00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:45.154
Hurt him? He almost killed me six times!

594
00:51:46.063 --> 00:51:47.531
Which is fine!

595
00:51:47.648 --> 00:51:49.116
This hyperdrive blows,
there are gonna be...

596
00:51:49.191 --> 00:51:51.159
pieces of us in three different systems.

597
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:55.531
What'd you do?

598
00:51:56.573 --> 00:51:58.496
I bypassed the compressor.

599
00:52:00.828 --> 00:52:01.829
Huh.

600
00:52:05.082 --> 00:52:06.379
Move, ball.

601
00:52:08.544 --> 00:52:10.638
Ah, don't say that.

602
00:52:10.712 --> 00:52:12.385
You did great. Just rest.

603
00:52:13.298 --> 00:52:14.390
Good job, kid.

604
00:52:14.842 --> 00:52:15.843
Thanks.

605
00:52:16.385 --> 00:52:17.682
You're welcome.

606
00:52:22.432 --> 00:52:23.854
HAN; So...

607
00:52:23.976 --> 00:52:25.319
fugitives, huh?

608
00:52:27.229 --> 00:52:28.526
The First Order wants the map.

609
00:52:28.605 --> 00:52:29.902
Finn is with the Resistance.

610
00:52:30.524 --> 00:52:31.946
I'm just a scavenger.

611
00:52:33.986 --> 00:52:34.987
Let's see what you got.

612
00:52:35.863 --> 00:52:37.957
Go ahead.

613
00:52:47.082 --> 00:52:49.255
This map's not complete.

614
00:52:49.334 --> 00:52:50.836
It's just a piece.

615
00:52:52.045 --> 00:52:53.843
Ever since Luke disappeared...

616
00:52:53.964 --> 00:52:55.966
people have been looking for him.

617
00:52:56.049 --> 00:52:57.551
Why did he leave?

618
00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:01.513
He was training
a new generation of Jedi.

619
00:53:01.597 --> 00:53:03.270
One boy, an apprentice...

620
00:53:03.348 --> 00:53:05.646
turned against him, destroyed it all.

621
00:53:07.227 --> 00:53:09.150
Luke felt responsible.

622
00:53:09.229 --> 00:53:11.732
He just walked away from everything.

623
00:53:12.441 --> 00:53:13.909
Do you know what happened to him?

624
00:53:14.067 --> 00:53:16.445
A lot of rumors. Stories.

625
00:53:18.447 --> 00:53:20.666
People that knew him best...

626
00:53:22.159 --> 00:53:24.537
think he went looking
for the first Jedi temple.

627
00:53:26.288 --> 00:53:27.631
The Jedi were real?

628
00:53:27.706 --> 00:53:29.925
I used to wonder about that myself.

629
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.219
Thought it was a bunch
of mumbo-jumbo.

630
00:53:33.086 --> 00:53:35.680
A magical power holding
together good and evil...

631
00:53:35.756 --> 00:53:37.884
the dark side and the light.

632
00:53:39.259 --> 00:53:41.432
Crazy thing is...

633
00:53:44.223 --> 00:53:45.270
it's true.

634
00:53:47.809 --> 00:53:49.436
The Force. The Jedi.

635
00:53:52.022 --> 00:53:53.023
All Of it.

636
00:53:56.276 --> 00:53:57.619
It's all true.

637
00:54:00.864 --> 00:54:02.992
No, you rest.

638
00:54:03.116 --> 00:54:05.869
You want my help? You're getting it.

639
00:54:05.953 --> 00:54:08.001
Gonna see an old friend.
She'll get your droid home.

640
00:54:09.289 --> 00:54:10.632
This is our stop.

641
00:54:28.016 --> 00:54:29.518
I didn't know there was
this much green...

642
00:54:29.601 --> 00:54:30.898
in the whole galaxy.

643
00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.928
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what
we're walking into here...

644
00:55:01.049 --> 00:55:02.676
Did you just call me Solo?

645
00:55:02.759 --> 00:55:04.386
Sorry. Han. Mr. Solo.

646
00:55:04.469 --> 00:55:05.561
You should know...

647
00:55:05.637 --> 00:55:08.015
I'm a big deal in the Resistance.

648
00:55:08.098 --> 00:55:10.442
Which puts a real target on my back.

649
00:55:10.559 --> 00:55:12.152
Are there any conspirators here?

650
00:55:12.227 --> 00:55:14.104
Like, First Order sympathizers?

651
00:55:14.229 --> 00:55:16.903
Listen, Big Deal.

652
00:55:16.982 --> 00:55:18.905
You got another problem.

653
00:55:18.984 --> 00:55:21.157
Women always figure out the truth.

654
00:55:22.738 --> 00:55:24.081
Always.

655
00:55:30.078 --> 00:55:31.455
You might need this.

656
00:55:32.748 --> 00:55:34.421
I think I can handle myself.

657
00:55:34.541 --> 00:55:36.669
I know you do. That's why
I'm giving it to you.

658
00:55:36.752 --> 00:55:37.753
Take it.

659
00:55:40.589 --> 00:55:41.761
You know how to use one of those?

660
00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.513
Yeah. You pull the trigger.

661
00:55:43.592 --> 00:55:45.435
Little bit more to it than that.

662
00:55:45.927 --> 00:55:47.600
You got a lot to learn.

663
00:55:49.014 --> 00:55:50.266
You got a name?

664
00:55:51.183 --> 00:55:52.184
<i>REY -</i>

665
00:55:52.893 --> 00:55:53.894
<i>REY -</i>

666
00:55:57.773 --> 00:56:00.196
I been thinking about bringing
on some more crew, Rey.

667
00:56:00.275 --> 00:56:02.243
A second mate. Someone to help out.

668
00:56:02.319 --> 00:56:03.946
Someone who can keep up
with Chewie and me...

669
00:56:04.029 --> 00:56:05.622
appreciates the Falcon.

670
00:56:05.739 --> 00:56:07.537
Are you offering me a job?

671
00:56:07.616 --> 00:56:10.119
I wouldn't be nice to you.
Doesn't pay much.

672
00:56:10.243 --> 00:56:12.086
You're offering me a job.

673
00:56:13.288 --> 00:56:14.790
I'm thinking about it.

674
00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:19.632
Well?

675
00:56:24.132 --> 00:56:26.806
If you were, I'd be flattered.
But I have to get home.

676
00:56:27.719 --> 00:56:29.221
Where, Jakku?

677
00:56:29.805 --> 00:56:31.603
I've already been away too long.

678
00:56:33.308 --> 00:56:35.686
Chewie, check out the ship
as best you can.

679
00:56:39.398 --> 00:56:42.322
That's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.

680
00:56:45.404 --> 00:56:47.077
Solo, why are we here again?

681
00:56:47.197 --> 00:56:48.699
To get your droid on a clean ship.

682
00:56:48.824 --> 00:56:49.791
Clean?

683
00:56:49.866 --> 00:56:52.745
You think it was luck
that Chewie and I found the Falcon?

684
00:56:53.412 --> 00:56:54.959
If we can find it on our scanners...

685
00:56:55.038 --> 00:56:57.382
the First Order's not far behind.

686
00:56:57.499 --> 00:57:00.298
Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance?

687
00:57:00.377 --> 00:57:02.220
Maz Kanata's our best bet.

688
00:57:03.088 --> 00:57:04.590
We can trust her, right?

689
00:57:04.673 --> 00:57:06.220
Relax, kid.

690
00:57:06.341 --> 00:57:09.015
She's run this watering hole
for a thousand years.

691
00:57:09.761 --> 00:57:11.809
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste...

692
00:57:11.888 --> 00:57:13.265
so let me do the talking.

693
00:57:13.348 --> 00:57:15.100
And whatever you do, don't stare.

694
00:57:15.183 --> 00:57:16.230
At what?

695
00:57:17.269 --> 00:57:18.361
Any of it.

696
00:57:39.541 --> 00:57:41.543
Han Solo!

697
00:57:45.714 --> 00:57:46.966
Oh, boy.

698
00:57:47.090 --> 00:57:48.262
Hey, Maz.

699
00:57:52.095 --> 00:57:54.063
Where's my boyfriend?

700
00:57:54.556 --> 00:57:56.183
Chewie's working on the Falcon.

701
00:57:56.266 --> 00:57:57.267
I like that Wookiee.

702
00:57:58.059 --> 00:58:00.027
I assume you need something.

703
00:58:00.103 --> 00:58:01.525
Desperately.

704
00:58:01.605 --> 00:58:02.606
Let's get to it.

705
00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:58.628
<i>KYLO REN". Forgive me.</i>

706
00:59:01.289 --> 00:59:02.962
<i>I feel it again.</i>

707
00:59:06.628 --> 00:59:08.175
<i>The pull to the light.</i>

708
00:59:11.007 --> 00:59:13.510
<i>Supreme Leader senses it.</i>

709
00:59:14.594 --> 00:59:15.971
<i>Show me again.</i>

710
00:59:16.471 --> 00:59:18.644
<i>The power of the darkness.</i>

711
00:59:19.933 --> 00:59:22.527
<i>And I will let nothing stand in our way.</i>

712
00:59:23.478 --> 00:59:24.855
<i>Show me...</i>

713
00:59:27.023 --> 00:59:28.366
Grandfather...

714
00:59:30.819 --> 00:59:33.163
<i>and I Will finish...</i>

715
00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:34.657
<i>what you started.</i>

716
00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:48.882
A map.

717
00:59:49.504 --> 00:59:51.632
To Skywalker himself?

718
00:59:51.715 --> 00:59:54.468
You are right back
in the mess.

719
00:59:54.551 --> 00:59:58.021
Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia.

720
00:59:58.847 --> 00:59:59.848
Hmm...

721
00:59:59.973 --> 01:00:00.974
No.

722
01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:06.355
You've been running away
from this fight for too long.

723
01:00:06.855 --> 01:00:07.822
Han.

724
01:00:10.525 --> 01:00:12.027
Go home.

725
01:00:12.694 --> 01:00:13.991
Leia doesn't wanna see me.

726
01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:16.289
Please, we came here for your help.

727
01:00:17.532 --> 01:00:18.533
What fight?

728
01:00:19.743 --> 01:00:21.791
The only fight.

729
01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:24.043
Against the dark side.

730
01:00:24.122 --> 01:00:25.465
Through the ages...

731
01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:27.668
I've seen evil take many forms.

732
01:00:28.752 --> 01:00:30.971
The Sith. The Empire.

733
01:00:31.046 --> 01:00:34.391
Today, it is the First Order.

734
01:00:35.175 --> 01:00:38.099
Their shadow is spreading
across the galaxy.

735
01:00:38.219 --> 01:00:39.596
We must face them.

736
01:00:39.721 --> 01:00:41.769
Fight them.

737
01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:43.437
All of us.

738
01:00:44.059 --> 01:00:45.652
There is no fight against the First Order.

739
01:00:45.727 --> 01:00:46.853
Not one we can win.

740
01:00:48.063 --> 01:00:49.315
Look around.

741
01:00:49.397 --> 01:00:51.775
There's no chance we haven't
been recognized already.

742
01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:54.119
I bet you the First Order
is on their way right...

743
01:00:55.403 --> 01:00:56.404
What's this?

744
01:00:58.239 --> 01:00:59.240
What are you doing?

745
01:01:03.953 --> 01:01:05.455
Solo, what is she doing?

746
01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:07.332
I don't know. But it ain't good.

747
01:01:07.499 --> 01:01:09.297
If you live long enough...

748
01:01:09.376 --> 01:01:12.880
you see the same eyes
in different people.

749
01:01:13.797 --> 01:01:18.268
I'm looking at the eyes
of a man who wants to run.

750
01:01:21.137 --> 01:01:23.105
You don't know a thing about me.

751
01:01:24.432 --> 01:01:27.436
Where I'm from. What I've seen.

752
01:01:28.103 --> 01:01:30.777
You don't know the First Order like I do.

753
01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:33.904
They'll slaughter us.

754
01:01:33.983 --> 01:01:36.111
We all need to run.

755
01:01:37.237 --> 01:01:38.284
Hmm.

756
01:01:44.577 --> 01:01:45.578
You see those two?

757
01:01:46.287 --> 01:01:47.914
They'll trade work for transportation...

758
01:01:48.039 --> 01:01:49.461
to the Outer Rim.

759
01:01:49.541 --> 01:01:51.760
There, you can disappear.

760
01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.961
Finn?

761
01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.381
Come with me.

762
01:01:57.424 --> 01:01:59.472
What about BB-8? We're not done yet.

763
01:01:59.551 --> 01:02:01.224
We have to get him back to your base.

764
01:02:06.307 --> 01:02:07.650
I can't.

765
01:02:16.443 --> 01:02:17.660
Keep it, kid.

766
01:02:27.912 --> 01:02:29.334
Who's the girl?

767
01:02:34.294 --> 01:02:36.262
I was told you can get me
to the Outer Rim.

768
01:02:36.337 --> 01:02:37.429
What are you doing?

769
01:02:39.174 --> 01:02:40.175
Don't leave without me.

770
01:02:44.012 --> 01:02:45.855
You can't just go. I won't let you.

771
01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:47.022
I'm not who you think I am.

772
01:02:47.098 --> 01:02:48.190
Finn, what are you talking about?

773
01:02:48.266 --> 01:02:49.313
I'm not Resistance.

774
01:02:50.018 --> 01:02:51.520
I'm not a hero.

775
01:02:54.773 --> 01:02:56.525
I'm a stormtrooper.

776
01:02:57.692 --> 01:03:00.616
Like all of them, I was taken
from a family I'll never know.

777
01:03:01.362 --> 01:03:03.364
And raised to do one thing.

778
01:03:04.073 --> 01:03:07.202
But my first battle, I made a choice.

779
01:03:08.369 --> 01:03:10.212
I wasn't gonna kill for them.

780
01:03:10.872 --> 01:03:13.796
So I ran. Right into you.

781
01:03:15.376 --> 01:03:17.470
And you looked at me
like no one ever had.

782
01:03:20.381 --> 01:03:22.679
I was ashamed of what I was.

783
01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.222
But I'm done with the First Order.

784
01:03:27.347 --> 01:03:29.145
I'm never going back.

785
01:03:31.226 --> 01:03:32.978
Rey, come with me.

786
01:03:34.062 --> 01:03:35.314
Don't go.

787
01:03:40.485 --> 01:03:42.237
Take care of yourself.

788
01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:45.703
Please.

789
01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.514
No!

790
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:03.762
<i>No!</i>

791
01:04:17.063 --> 01:04:19.942
<i>No! Come back!</i>

792
01:04:20.942 --> 01:04:22.740
<i>No!</i>

793
01:04:38.793 --> 01:04:40.636
<i>Come back!</i>

794
01:04:50.972 --> 01:04:52.815
No!

795
01:05:43.775 --> 01:05:45.618
No!

796
01:05:45.693 --> 01:05:47.240
Its energy...

797
01:05:51.032 --> 01:05:53.080
<i>- ...surrounds us...
- No!</i>

798
01:05:53.201 --> 01:05:55.545
...and <i>binds</i> us...

799
01:06:03.378 --> 01:06:04.504
The <i>Force will</i> be...

800
01:06:13.554 --> 01:06:15.056
No!

801
01:06:15.181 --> 01:06:17.058
Come back!

802
01:06:17.183 --> 01:06:18.685
<i>UNKAR". Quiet, girl.</i>

803
01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.561
No!

804
01:06:25.149 --> 01:06:26.150
<i>Rey?</i>

805
01:06:30.738 --> 01:06:33.457
<i>These are your first steps.</i>

806
01:06:38.413 --> 01:06:39.414
What was that?

807
01:06:41.666 --> 01:06:43.384
I shouldn't have gone in there.

808
01:06:45.628 --> 01:06:48.097
That lightsaber was Luke's.

809
01:06:48.172 --> 01:06:49.970
And his father's before him.

810
01:06:50.091 --> 01:06:53.721
And now, it calls to you.

811
01:06:53.845 --> 01:06:55.267
I have to get back to Jakku.

812
01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:57.603
Han told me.

813
01:07:05.356 --> 01:07:07.404
Dear child.

814
01:07:07.483 --> 01:07:09.531
I see your eyes.

815
01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:12.614
You already know the truth.

816
01:07:12.697 --> 01:07:15.166
Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku...

817
01:07:16.451 --> 01:07:18.453
they're never coming back.

818
01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:25.626
But...

819
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:28.133
there's someone who still could.

820
01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.433
Luke.

821
01:07:32.508 --> 01:07:36.183
The belonging you seek
is not behind you...

822
01:07:36.304 --> 01:07:37.977
it is ahead.

823
01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:41.647
I am no Jedi, but I know the Force.

824
01:07:41.768 --> 01:07:45.864
It moves through and surrounds
every living thing.

825
01:07:47.774 --> 01:07:49.367
Close your eyes.

826
01:07:51.652 --> 01:07:52.653
Feel it.

827
01:07:53.946 --> 01:07:56.040
The light...

828
01:07:56.157 --> 01:07:58.535
it's always been there.

829
01:07:58.659 --> 01:08:00.661
It will guide you.

830
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:04.837
The saber. Take it.

831
01:08:08.836 --> 01:08:10.804
I'm never touching that thing again.

832
01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.382
I don't want any part of this.

833
01:08:15.843 --> 01:08:16.844
Hmm.

834
01:08:38.866 --> 01:08:42.370
<i><i>Today is the end
of the Republic.</i>

835
01:08:44.372 --> 01:08:49.879
<i>The end of a regime
that acquiesces to disorder.</i>

836
01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:55.266
<i>At this very moment,
in a system far from here...</i>

837
01:08:55.383 --> 01:09:00.230
<i>the New Republic lies to the galaxy...</i>

838
01:09:00.346 --> 01:09:03.941
<i>while secretly supporting
the treachery...</i>

839
01:09:04.725 --> 01:09:08.070
<i>of the loathsome Resistance.</i>

840
01:09:08.146 --> 01:09:11.650
<i>This fierce machine
which you have built...</i>

841
01:09:11.732 --> 01:09:13.575
<i>upon which we stand...</i>

842
01:09:13.693 --> 01:09:16.071
<i>will bring an end to the Senate!</i>

843
01:09:16.154 --> 01:09:18.998
<i>To their cherished fleet!</i>

844
01:09:19.073 --> 01:09:23.544
<i>All remaining systems
will bow to the First Order!</i>

845
01:09:23.619 --> 01:09:26.122
<i>And will remember this...</i>

846
01:09:26.247 --> 01:09:31.299
<i>as the last day of the Republic!</i>

847
01:09:33.087 --> 01:09:35.215
Confirm transfer to manual control.

848
01:09:35.298 --> 01:09:36.845
Configure!

849
01:09:36.966 --> 01:09:38.434
<i>Fire!</i>

850
01:10:38.486 --> 01:10:41.160
CITIZEN; No. What is it?

851
01:10:57.171 --> 01:10:58.343
It was the Republic.

852
01:10:59.507 --> 01:11:01.134
The First Order, they've done it.

853
01:11:03.511 --> 01:11:04.683
Where's Rey?

854
01:11:21.946 --> 01:11:24.199
What are you doing?

855
01:11:25.199 --> 01:11:27.418
You have to go back.

856
01:11:27.493 --> 01:11:28.619
I'm leaving.

857
01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:30.872
BB-8...

858
01:11:30.955 --> 01:11:32.047
No, you can't.

859
01:11:32.123 --> 01:11:34.296
You have to go back,
you're too important.

860
01:11:34.375 --> 01:11:35.547
They'll help you.

861
01:11:50.224 --> 01:11:51.521
I've had this for ages.

862
01:11:55.563 --> 01:11:56.906
Kept it locked away.

863
01:11:57.356 --> 01:11:58.357
Where'd you get that?

864
01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:02.745
A good question. For another time.

865
01:12:03.738 --> 01:12:04.830
Take it.

866
01:12:04.905 --> 01:12:06.407
Find your friend!

867
01:12:13.581 --> 01:12:15.583
Those beasts.

868
01:12:15.708 --> 01:12:16.709
They're here.

869
01:12:40.608 --> 01:12:43.282
<i>FN-417, hold position.</i>

870
01:12:45.112 --> 01:12:46.785
Oh, safety.

871
01:13:12.473 --> 01:13:13.565
STORMTROOPERI Sir.

872
01:13:13.641 --> 01:13:14.984
<i>The droid was spotted heading west.</i>

873
01:13:15.059 --> 01:13:16.060
<i>With a girl.</i>

874
01:13:21.607 --> 01:13:24.076
You have to keep going.
Stay out of sight.

875
01:13:24.151 --> 01:13:26.995
I'll try to fight them off.

876
01:13:27.071 --> 01:13:28.323
I hope so, too.

877
01:13:40.751 --> 01:13:42.674
Come on, Chewie!

878
01:13:45.089 --> 01:13:47.091
Rey and BB-8! They need you!

879
01:13:47.174 --> 01:13:48.175
Now! Go!

880
01:13:48.259 --> 01:13:50.603
I need a weapon!

881
01:13:50.678 --> 01:13:52.146
You have one!

882
01:14:01.522 --> 01:14:04.196
Hey, can I try that?

883
01:14:10.698 --> 01:14:12.166
I like this thing.

884
01:14:18.122 --> 01:14:19.419
<i>Traitor!</i>

885
01:15:04.168 --> 01:15:06.011

- Thanks.

886
01:15:06.086 --> 01:15:07.087
Don't move-.

01:15:08.339 --> 01:15:10.091
<i>TK-338, we have targets in custody.</i>

<i>Move! Move! Move!</i>

<i>Scramble all squads, repeat,

<i>Head to higher cover and wait
for our position!</i>

892
01:15:29.276 --> 01:15:30.778
It's the Resistance.

893
01:15:38.619 --> 01:15:40.872
Go straight at them!
Don't let these dogs scare you!

894
01:15:40.955 --> 01:15:42.582
<i>- JESS". Copy that.
- We're with you, Poe.</i>

01:16:40.306 --> 01:16:42.604
Whoo! Yeah!

897
01:16:43.267 --> 01:16:45.110
That's one hell of a pilot!

898
01:16:45.269 --> 01:16:46.521

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:22.624
<i>Sir, Resistance fighters.</i>

907
01:18:23.575 --> 01:18:25.168
<i>We need more troops.</i>

908
01:18:25.285 --> 01:18:27.128
<i>KYLO REN'. Pull the division out.</i>

909
01:18:27.246 --> 01:18:30.295
<i>Forget the droid.
We have what we need.</i>

910
01:18:37.131 --> 01:18:38.428
<i>Pull back to tree line!</i>

911
01:18:53.814 --> 01:18:55.361
No!

912
01:18:59.069 --> 01:19:00.491
No, no!

913
01:19:02.406 --> 01:19:04.500
No! No!

914
01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.503
Rey!

915
01:19:26.513 --> 01:19:28.515
He took her. Did you see that?

916
01:19:29.349 --> 01:19:30.771
He took her. She's gone.

917
01:19:30.851 --> 01:19:32.023
Yeah, I know.

918
01:19:41.361 --> 01:19:42.704
Let's g0.

919
01:19:56.376 --> 01:19:58.879
Goodness! Han Solo!

920
01:19:59.004 --> 01:20:01.177
It is I, C-3PO.

921
01:20:01.715 --> 01:20:03.217
You probably don't recognize me...

922
01:20:03.383 --> 01:20:04.851
because of the red arm.

923
01:20:04.968 --> 01:20:06.891
Look who it is, did you see who...

924
01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:09.681
Uh...

925
01:20:10.224 --> 01:20:11.225
Hmm.

926
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:14.399
Excuse me, Prin... General. Sorry.

927
01:20:14.478 --> 01:20:16.822
Come along, BB-8, quickly.

928
01:20:16.897 --> 01:20:19.571
Yes, I must get
my proper arm reinstalled.

929
01:20:21.485 --> 01:20:23.237
You changed your hair.

930
01:20:25.572 --> 01:20:26.994
Same jacket.

931
01:20:28.242 --> 01:20:30.040
No, new jacket.

932
01:20:43.006 --> 01:20:44.007
I saw him.

933
01:20:45.926 --> 01:20:48.099
Leia, I saw our son.

934
01:20:49.763 --> 01:20:51.060
He was here.

935
01:21:31.847 --> 01:21:32.848
CREWMANI Hey!

936
01:21:37.436 --> 01:21:39.313
BB-8, my buddy.

937
01:21:39.438 --> 01:21:41.406
Oh, it's so good to see you.

938
01:21:41.481 --> 01:21:42.482
Finn saved you?

939
01:21:42.566 --> 01:21:43.658
Where is he?

940
01:21:43.775 --> 01:21:44.992
Poe?

941
01:21:46.528 --> 01:21:47.529
Oh, n0.

942
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:49.577
Poe Dameron, you're alive?

943
01:21:49.656 --> 01:21:51.829
- Buddy! So are you!
- What happened to you?

944
01:21:51.909 --> 01:21:53.252
I got thrown from the crash.

945
01:21:53.327 --> 01:21:55.250
I woke up at night.
No you. No ship. Nothing.

946
01:21:55.329 --> 01:21:56.706
BB-8 says that you saved him.

947
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:58.332
No, no, no. It wasn'tjust me.

948
01:21:58.457 --> 01:21:59.959
You completed my mission, Finn...

949
01:22:00.042 --> 01:22:01.043
That's my jacket.

950
01:22:01.209 --> 01:22:03.587
- Oh...
- No, no, no.

951
01:22:03.670 --> 01:22:05.422
Keep it. It suits you.

952
01:22:06.298 --> 01:22:08.050
You're a good man, Finn.

953
01:22:08.967 --> 01:22:10.935
Poe, I need your help.

954
01:22:12.471 --> 01:22:15.315
<i>PZ-4CO,
report to communications.</i>

955
01:22:18.393 --> 01:22:19.394
General Organa...

956
01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:23.357
I'm sorry to interrupt. This is Finn.

957
01:22:23.482 --> 01:22:26.326
- He needs to talk to you.
- And I need to talk to him.

958
01:22:26.401 --> 01:22:28.199
That was incredibly brave what you did.

959
01:22:28.278 --> 01:22:30.872
Renouncing the First Order,
saving this man's life.

960
01:22:30.989 --> 01:22:32.866
Thank you, ma'am. But a friend
of mine was taken prisoner.

961
01:22:32.991 --> 01:22:34.868
Han told me about the girl.

962
01:22:34.952 --> 01:22:36.078
I'm sorry.

963
01:22:36.203 --> 01:22:38.251
Finn's familiar with the weapon
that destroyed the Hosnian system.

964
01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:39.331
He worked on the base.

965
01:22:39.831 --> 01:22:41.754
We're desperate for anything
you can tell us.

966
01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:43.127
That's where my friend was taken.

967
01:22:43.210 --> 01:22:44.507
I've got to get there fast.

968
01:22:44.628 --> 01:22:46.096
And I will do everything I can to help...

969
01:22:46.171 --> 01:22:48.390
but first you need to tell us
all you know.

970
01:22:51.385 --> 01:22:53.103
That sounds very scary.

971
01:22:55.222 --> 01:22:57.350
You must be so brave.

972
01:23:00.185 --> 01:23:01.186
General...

973
01:23:01.311 --> 01:23:02.688
I regret to inform you...

974
01:23:02.771 --> 01:23:04.398
but this map recovered from BB-8...

975
01:23:04.481 --> 01:23:05.983
is only partially complete.

976
01:23:06.066 --> 01:23:09.821
And even worse, it matches
no charted system on record.

977
01:23:09.903 --> 01:23:12.031
We simply do not have
enough information...

978
01:23:12.114 --> 01:23:13.616
to locate Master Luke.

979
01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:16.702
Can't believe I was so foolish
to think I could find Luke...

980
01:23:16.785 --> 01:23:17.786
and bring him home.

981
01:23:17.911 --> 01:23:19.037
Leia.

982
01:23:19.121 --> 01:23:20.213
Don't do that.

983
01:23:20.288 --> 01:23:21.505
Do what?

984
01:23:21.581 --> 01:23:22.707
Anything-

985
01:23:24.126 --> 01:23:26.003
Princesses.

986
01:23:26.128 --> 01:23:27.675
I'm trying to be helpful.

987
01:23:28.839 --> 01:23:29.931
When did that ever help?

988
01:23:30.007 --> 01:23:31.725
And don't say the Death Star.

989
01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:47.941
C-3POI BB-8.

990
01:23:48.066 --> 01:23:51.115
You're wasting your time.

991
01:23:51.194 --> 01:23:52.946
It is very doubtful that R2 would have

992
01:23:53.113 --> 01:23:54.285
the rest of the map in his backup data.

993
01:23:54.448 --> 01:23:56.576
I am afraid not.

994
01:23:56.658 --> 01:24:00.708
R2-D2 has been in low-power mode
ever since Master Luke went away.

995
01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:06.544
Sadly, he may never be
his old self again.

996
01:24:08.253 --> 01:24:09.880
Listen to me, will you?

997
01:24:10.881 --> 01:24:13.225
I know every time you...

998
01:24:15.427 --> 01:24:17.805
Every time you look at me
you're reminded of him.

999
01:24:17.888 --> 01:24:19.890
You think I want to forget him?

1000
01:24:19.973 --> 01:24:21.646
I want him back.

1001
01:24:21.767 --> 01:24:23.861
There's nothing more we could
have done.

1002
01:24:25.604 --> 01:24:26.981
There's too much Vader in him.

1003
01:24:27.064 --> 01:24:29.988
That's why I wanted him
to train with Luke.

1004
01:24:30.067 --> 01:24:31.785
I just never should have sent him away.

1005
01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:33.453
That's when I lost him.

1006
01:24:34.696 --> 01:24:36.698
That's when I lost you both.

1007
01:24:38.784 --> 01:24:41.458
We both had to deal with it
in our own way.

1008
01:24:42.454 --> 01:24:45.424
I went back to the only thing
I was ever any good at.

1009
01:24:45.999 --> 01:24:47.216
We both did.

1010
01:24:49.419 --> 01:24:51.171
We lost our son.

1011
01:24:51.254 --> 01:24:52.426
Forever.

1012
01:24:52.506 --> 01:24:53.507
No.

1013
01:24:53.632 --> 01:24:55.179
It was Snoke.

1014
01:24:55.634 --> 01:24:58.262
He seduced our son to the dark side.

1015
01:24:58.345 --> 01:24:59.938
But we can still save him.

1016
01:25:00.639 --> 01:25:01.765
Me.

1017
01:25:02.682 --> 01:25:03.729
You.

1018
01:25:04.559 --> 01:25:06.903
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?

1019
01:25:06.978 --> 01:25:08.400
Luke is a Jedi.

1020
01:25:09.981 --> 01:25:11.324
You're his father.

1021
01:25:14.027 --> 01:25:17.827
There is still light in him, I know it.

1022
01:25:17.906 --> 01:25:19.624
General...

1023
01:25:19.699 --> 01:25:22.202
the reconnaissance report
on the enemy base is coming.

1024
01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:50.021
Where am I?

1025
01:25:52.357 --> 01:25:53.700
<i>You're my guest.</i>

1026
01:25:53.775 --> 01:25:55.118
Where are the others?

1027
01:25:55.193 --> 01:25:56.866
<i>Do you mean the murderers...</i>

1028
01:25:56.945 --> 01:25:59.824
<i>traitors, and thieves you call friends?</i>

1029
01:26:00.782 --> 01:26:03.251
<i>You'll be relieved to hear
I have no idea.</i>

1030
01:26:05.245 --> 01:26:07.339
<i>You still want to kill me.</i>

1031
01:26:08.123 --> 01:26:09.796
That happens
when you're being hunted...

1032
01:26:09.875 --> 01:26:11.798
by a creature in a mask.

1033
01:26:36.735 --> 01:26:38.578
Tell me about the droid.

1034
01:26:39.404 --> 01:26:41.247
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive...

1035
01:26:41.323 --> 01:26:42.666
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.

1036
01:26:42.741 --> 01:26:44.869
It's carrying a section
of a navigational chart.

1037
01:26:44.951 --> 01:26:46.328
And we have the rest.

1038
01:26:46.411 --> 01:26:48.209
Recovered from the archives
of the Empire...

1039
01:26:48.288 --> 01:26:49.380
but we need the last piece.

1040
01:26:49.456 --> 01:26:51.925
And somehow you convinced
the droid to show it to you.

1041
01:26:53.543 --> 01:26:54.544
You.

1042
01:26:56.004 --> 01:26:57.256
A scavenger.

1043
01:26:59.591 --> 01:27:01.719
You know I can take whatever I want.

1044
01:27:07.849 --> 01:27:09.772
You're so lonely.

1045
01:27:11.770 --> 01:27:13.272
So afraid to leave.

1046
01:27:17.442 --> 01:27:20.366
At night, desperate to sleep.

1047
01:27:23.490 --> 01:27:25.083
You imagine an ocean.

1048
01:27:26.034 --> 01:27:27.331
I see it.

1049
01:27:28.578 --> 01:27:30.330
I see the island.

1050
01:27:34.918 --> 01:27:36.215
And Han Solo.

1051
01:27:38.546 --> 01:27:40.719
You feel like he's the father
you never had.

1052
01:27:41.341 --> 01:27:42.843
He would have disappointed you.

1053
01:27:42.968 --> 01:27:44.265
Get out of my head.

1054
01:27:45.387 --> 01:27:46.934
I know you've seen the map.

1055
01:27:48.515 --> 01:27:49.687
It's in there.

1056
01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:51.852
And now you'll give it to me.

1057
01:28:00.485 --> 01:28:02.533
Don't be afraid. I feel it, too.

1058
01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:07.493
I'm not giving you anything.

1059
01:28:08.118 --> 01:28:09.210
We'll see.

1060
01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.201
You.

1061
01:28:51.286 --> 01:28:52.287
You're afraid.

1062
01:28:55.332 --> 01:28:58.256
That you will never be
as strong as Darth Vader.

1063
01:29:07.427 --> 01:29:09.270
<i>The scavenger...</i>

1064
01:29:09.387 --> 01:29:11.014
resisted you?

1065
01:29:11.097 --> 01:29:12.690
She is strong with the Force.

1066
01:29:12.766 --> 01:29:14.564
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.

1067
01:29:14.642 --> 01:29:15.859
And the droid?

1068
01:29:15.935 --> 01:29:19.280
Ren believed it was no longer
valuable to us.

1069
01:29:19.356 --> 01:29:21.984
That the girl was all we needed.

1070
01:29:22.108 --> 01:29:24.577
As a result, the droid has
most likely been returned...

1071
01:29:24.652 --> 01:29:25.778
to the hands of the enemy.

1072
01:29:25.904 --> 01:29:27.622
They may have the map already.

1073
01:29:27.697 --> 01:29:29.324
Then the Resistance
must be destroyed...

1074
01:29:29.449 --> 01:29:31.451
before they get to Skywalker.

1075
01:29:31.534 --> 01:29:33.411
We have their location.

1076
01:29:33.495 --> 01:29:36.123
We tracked their reconnaissance ship
to the lleenium system.

1077
01:29:37.123 --> 01:29:38.420
Good.

1078
01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:41.379
Then we will crush them
once and for all.

1079
01:29:41.461 --> 01:29:43.213
Prepare the weapon.

1080
01:29:43.838 --> 01:29:46.637
Supreme Leader, I can get
the map from the girl.

1081
01:29:46.716 --> 01:29:48.514
I just need your guidance.

1082
01:29:50.136 --> 01:29:54.232
If what you say about this girl is true...

1083
01:29:54.849 --> 01:29:59.525
Bring her to me.

1084
01:30:13.493 --> 01:30:15.666
You will remove these restraints...

1085
01:30:15.745 --> 01:30:18.840
and leave this cell with the door open.

1086
01:30:22.585 --> 01:30:24.337
<i>STORMTROOPER". What did you say?</i>

1087
01:30:27.257 --> 01:30:28.759
You will remove these restraints...

1088
01:30:28.842 --> 01:30:31.516
and leave this cell with the door open.

1089
01:30:38.351 --> 01:30:39.898
<i>I'll tighten
those restraints...</i>

1090
01:30:40.019 --> 01:30:42.067
<i>SCHVGHQGF scum.</i>

1091
01:30:56.369 --> 01:30:57.962
You will remove these restraints...

1092
01:30:58.037 --> 01:31:00.415
and leave this cell with the door open.

1093
01:31:04.127 --> 01:31:05.720
<i>I will remove
these restraints...</i>

1094
01:31:05.795 --> 01:31:07.547
<i>and leave the cell with the door open.</i>

1095
01:31:16.473 --> 01:31:19.522
- And you'll drop your weapon.
<i>- And</i> I'll <i>drop my</i> weapon.

1096
01:31:32.238 --> 01:31:33.330
No.

1097
01:31:34.324 --> 01:31:35.325
No.

1098
01:31:37.243 --> 01:31:38.369
Guards!

1099
01:31:40.914 --> 01:31:41.915
<i>Guards!</i>

1100
01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:49.173
Begin charging the weapon.

1101
01:31:49.255 --> 01:31:50.598
Yes, sir.

1102
01:31:50.673 --> 01:31:51.970
Weapon charging.

1103
01:32:11.236 --> 01:32:13.238
The scan data from Snap's
reconnaissance flight...

1104
01:32:13.321 --> 01:32:14.664
confirms Finn's report.

1105
01:32:14.781 --> 01:32:16.749
They've somehow created
a hyper-lightspeed weapon...

1106
01:32:16.824 --> 01:32:18.121
built within the planet itself.

1107
01:32:18.284 --> 01:32:19.251
A laser cannon?

1108
01:32:19.327 --> 01:32:21.170
We're not sure how to describe
a weapon of this scale.

1109
01:32:21.287 --> 01:32:22.288
It's another Death Star.

1110
01:32:22.372 --> 01:32:24.124
I wish that were the case, Major.

1111
01:32:24.207 --> 01:32:25.459
This was the Death Star.

1112
01:32:28.211 --> 01:32:30.714
And this is Starkiller Base.

1113
01:32:31.214 --> 01:32:32.386
So, it's big.

1114
01:32:32.465 --> 01:32:35.560
How is it possible to power
a weapon of that size?

1115
01:32:35.677 --> 01:32:37.805
It uses the power of the sun.

1116
01:32:39.013 --> 01:32:40.185
As the weapon is charged...

1117
01:32:40.306 --> 01:32:42.400
the sun is drained until it disappears.

1118
01:32:42.475 --> 01:32:43.476
Ma'am.

1119
01:32:45.478 --> 01:32:46.525
The First Order...

1120
01:32:46.646 --> 01:32:48.068
they're charging the weapon again now.

1121
01:32:49.023 --> 01:32:50.900
Our system is the next target.

1122
01:32:51.025 --> 01:32:52.026
Oh, my.

1123
01:32:52.110 --> 01:32:53.612
Without the Republic fleet,
we're doomed.

1124
01:32:53.695 --> 01:32:55.493
Okay. How do we blow it up?

1125
01:32:55.572 --> 01:32:57.916
- There's always a way to do that.
- Han's right.

1126
01:32:57.991 --> 01:32:59.664
In order
for that amount of power...

1127
01:32:59.742 --> 01:33:01.119
to be contained...

1128
01:33:01.202 --> 01:33:03.170
that base has to have some
kind of thermal oscillator.

1129
01:33:03.288 --> 01:33:05.461
There is one. Precinct 47.

1130
01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:07.292
Here.

1131
01:33:07.375 --> 01:33:09.343
If we can destroy
that oscillator...

1132
01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:12.430
it might destabilize the core
and cripple the weapon.

1133
01:33:12.505 --> 01:33:14.303
- Maybe the planet.
- We'll go in there,

1134
01:33:14.382 --> 01:33:15.725
we'll hit that oscillator
with everything we've got.

1135
01:33:15.842 --> 01:33:17.185
They have defensive shields...

1136
01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:19.228
that our ships cannot penetrate.

1137
01:33:19.345 --> 01:33:20.767
We disable the shields.

1138
01:33:20.847 --> 01:33:22.520
Kid, you worked there.

1139
01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:23.641
What do you got?

1140
01:33:23.725 --> 01:33:24.942
I can do it.

1141
01:33:25.018 --> 01:33:26.270
I like this guy.

1142
01:33:26.394 --> 01:33:28.271
I can disable the shields,
but I have to be there.

1143
01:33:28.354 --> 01:33:29.822
On the planet.

1144
01:33:29.897 --> 01:33:31.524
- We'll get you there.
- Han, how?

1145
01:33:32.275 --> 01:33:33.777
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.

1146
01:33:33.901 --> 01:33:35.778
So we disable the shields...

1147
01:33:35.862 --> 01:33:38.160
we take out the oscillator
and we blow up their big gun.

1148
01:33:38.281 --> 01:33:40.375
All right. Let's go.

1149
01:34:02.889 --> 01:34:04.391
Chewie, check that donal capitator.

1150
01:34:04.474 --> 01:34:05.976
Come on. Let's go.

1151
01:34:06.059 --> 01:34:08.278
Finn, be careful with those.
They're explosives.

1152
01:34:08.394 --> 01:34:09.441
Now you tell me?

1153
01:34:09.562 --> 01:34:12.782
You know, no matter
how much we fought...

1154
01:34:14.192 --> 01:34:16.536
I've always hated watching you leave.

1155
01:34:16.611 --> 01:34:17.828
That's why I did it.

1156
01:34:19.072 --> 01:34:20.574
So you'd miss me.

1157
01:34:23.326 --> 01:34:25.124
I did miss you.

1158
01:34:26.579 --> 01:34:28.377
It wasn't all bad, was it?

1159
01:34:28.456 --> 01:34:29.548
Huh?

1160
01:34:29.624 --> 01:34:32.753
Some of it was... good.

1161
01:34:32.919 --> 01:34:34.592
Pretty good.

1162
01:34:37.924 --> 01:34:40.803
- Some things never change.
- True.

1163
01:34:41.344 --> 01:34:43.346
You still drive me crazy.

1164
01:34:52.522 --> 01:34:54.445
If you see our son...

1165
01:34:56.943 --> 01:34:58.616
bring him home.

1166
01:35:04.033 --> 01:35:06.707
<i>Sir, sensors
triggered in Hangar 718.</i>

1167
01:35:06.786 --> 01:35:08.459
<i>We're searching the area.</i>

1168
01:35:08.538 --> 01:35:10.666
<i>She's just beginning
to test her powers.</i>

1169
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:12.463
<i>The longer it takes to find her...</i>

1170
01:35:12.542 --> 01:35:14.215
<i>the more dangerous she becomes.</i>

1171
01:35:19.298 --> 01:35:20.925
All sentry droids...

1172
01:35:21.008 --> 01:35:22.225
<i>all sentry droids...</i>

1173
01:35:22.301 --> 01:35:24.554
<i>resynchronize
to Galactic Standard Time.</i>

1174
01:35:24.637 --> 01:35:26.639
<i>Offset 473.</i>

1175
01:35:29.392 --> 01:35:30.484
How are we getting in?

1176
01:35:30.601 --> 01:35:32.569
Their shields have
a fractional refresh rate.

1177
01:35:32.645 --> 01:35:34.318
Keeps anything traveling
slower than lightspeed...

1178
01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:35.823
from getting through.

1179
01:35:36.399 --> 01:35:38.493
We're making our landing
approach at lightspeed?

1180
01:35:39.944 --> 01:35:41.036
Chewie, get ready.

1181
01:35:42.321 --> 01:35:43.493
And... Now!

1182
01:35:47.410 --> 01:35:49.083
I am pulling up!

1183
01:35:55.793 --> 01:35:57.420
I get any higher...

1184
01:35:57.503 --> 01:35:58.755
they'll see us!

1185
01:36:20.693 --> 01:36:23.071
Sir, she was
not found in Hangar 718.

1186
01:36:23.196 --> 01:36:24.288
But all troops are on alert.

1187
01:36:24.363 --> 01:36:25.740
<i>Put every hangar on lockdown.</i>

1188
01:36:25.865 --> 01:36:27.538
<i>She's going to try to steal
a ship to esc...</i>

1189
01:36:30.161 --> 01:36:31.708
Han Solo.

1190
01:36:42.924 --> 01:36:44.642
The flooding tunnel is over that ridge.

1191
01:36:44.717 --> 01:36:45.969
We'll get in that way.

1192
01:36:46.052 --> 01:36:47.975
What was your job
when you were based here?

1193
01:36:48.054 --> 01:36:49.055
Sanitation.

1194
01:36:51.933 --> 01:36:53.651
Sanitation?

1195
01:36:53.726 --> 01:36:55.444
Then how do you know
how to disable the shields?

1196
01:36:55.561 --> 01:36:56.562
I don't.

1197
01:36:56.687 --> 01:36:58.439
I'm just here to get Rey.

1198
01:36:58.564 --> 01:37:02.159
People are counting on us.
The galaxy is counting on us.

1199
01:37:02.235 --> 01:37:03.578
Solo, we'll figure it out.

1200
01:37:04.529 --> 01:37:05.951
We'll use the Force.

1201
01:37:06.072 --> 01:37:08.166
That's not how the Force works.

1202
01:37:09.742 --> 01:37:12.291
Oh, really? You're cold?

1203
01:37:12.453 --> 01:37:13.454
Come on.

1204
01:37:20.878 --> 01:37:22.175
Report.

1205
01:37:22.255 --> 01:37:24.474
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.

1206
01:37:26.926 --> 01:37:27.927
Hey!

1207
01:37:31.097 --> 01:37:33.316
The longer we're here
the less luck we're gonna have.

1208
01:37:33.432 --> 01:37:35.935
- The shields.
- I have an idea about that.

1209
01:37:43.901 --> 01:37:46.370
- You remember me?
- FN-2187.

1210
01:37:46.445 --> 01:37:47.697
Not anymore.

1211
01:37:47.864 --> 01:37:49.207
The name's Finn and I'm in charge.

1212
01:37:49.282 --> 01:37:51.330
I'm in charge now, Phasma.
I'm in charge.

1213
01:37:51.409 --> 01:37:53.411
- Bring it down. Bring it down.
- Yeah.

1214
01:37:53.494 --> 01:37:54.620
Follow me.

1215
01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.268
<i>Have you
checked out the new T-17s?</i>

1216
01:38:09.343 --> 01:38:11.016
<i>The T-17s,
as far as I can tell...</i>

1217
01:38:11.137 --> 01:38:12.184
<i>are a great improvement.</i>

1218
01:38:12.305 --> 01:38:14.148
<i>STORMTROOPER 1". Yeah.
That's what they tell you.</i>

1219
01:38:14.265 --> 01:38:15.482
<i>But believe me, they don't hold up.</i>

1220
01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:17.102
<i>- They don't?
- No.</i>

1221
01:38:52.803 --> 01:38:54.555
You want me to blast
that bucket off your head?

1222
01:38:54.639 --> 01:38:55.765
Lower the shields.

1223
01:38:55.848 --> 01:38:57.691
<i>You're making a big mistake.</i>

1224
01:38:57.808 --> 01:38:59.902
Do it.

1225
01:39:04.148 --> 01:39:05.274
Solo, if this works...

1226
01:39:05.358 --> 01:39:07.611
we're not gonna have
a lot of time to find Rey.

1227
01:39:07.693 --> 01:39:09.070
Don't worry, kid.

1228
01:39:09.862 --> 01:39:11.284
We won't leave here without her.

1229
01:39:13.074 --> 01:39:15.953
<i>You can't be so stupid
as to think this will be easy.</i>

1230
01:39:16.035 --> 01:39:18.629
<i>My troops will storm
this block and kill you all.</i>

1231
01:39:18.704 --> 01:39:20.547
I disagree. What do we do with her?

1232
01:39:21.165 --> 01:39:22.712
Is there a garbage chute?

1233
01:39:23.376 --> 01:39:24.719
Trash compactor?

1234
01:39:25.878 --> 01:39:26.970
Yeah, there is.

1235
01:39:27.296 --> 01:39:28.843
General, their shields are down.

1236
01:39:28.923 --> 01:39:30.516
Thank the Maker!

1237
01:39:30.591 --> 01:39:32.343
Han did it. Send them in.

1238
01:39:32.426 --> 01:39:34.349
Give Poe full authorization for attack.

1239
01:39:34.428 --> 01:39:36.726
Black Leader,
go to sub-lights on your call.

1240
01:39:36.806 --> 01:39:37.807
Roger, base.

1241
01:39:37.890 --> 01:39:39.608
Red squad, Blue squad, take my lead.

1242
01:39:39.809 --> 01:39:41.811
Dropping out of lightspeed.

1243
01:39:55.574 --> 01:39:57.076
Almost in range.

1244
01:39:57.243 --> 01:39:59.996
Hit the target dead center.
As many runs as we can get.

1245
01:40:00.079 --> 01:40:01.956
Approaching target.

1246
01:40:05.918 --> 01:40:07.386
Fighters incoming!

1247
01:40:08.254 --> 01:40:09.847
OFFICER 2; Coming <i>at 28.336.</i>

1248
01:40:09.922 --> 01:40:11.720
Forty-five!
Shields up! Shields up!

1249
01:40:11.799 --> 01:40:13.472
Dispatch all squadrons.

1250
01:40:13.592 --> 01:40:15.094
Yes, General.

1251
01:40:15.928 --> 01:40:16.929
All right. Let's light it up.

1252
01:40:26.689 --> 01:40:28.783
- Ah, direct hit.
- But no damage!

1253
01:40:28.858 --> 01:40:30.110
<i>Yeah, we gotta
keep hitting it.</i>

1254
01:40:30.276 --> 01:40:31.573
Another bombing run.

1255
01:40:31.694 --> 01:40:34.413
<i>Remember, when the sun is gone
that weapon will be ready to fire.</i>

1256
01:40:34.488 --> 01:40:37.082
But as long as there's light,
we got a chance.

1257
01:40:38.784 --> 01:40:40.331
Guys, we got a lot of company!

1258
01:40:46.959 --> 01:40:48.586
<i>We think
they may be splitting up.</i>

1259
01:40:48.669 --> 01:40:50.637
<i>Heading to quadrants 4 and 5.</i>

1260
01:40:58.471 --> 01:41:00.473
We'll use the charges
to blow that blast door.

1261
01:41:00.556 --> 01:41:03.309
I'll go in and draw fire,
but I'm gonna need cover.

1262
01:41:03.392 --> 01:41:04.484
You sure you're up for this?

1263
01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:05.777
Hell, no.

1264
01:41:05.853 --> 01:41:07.150
I'll go in and try to find Rey.

1265
01:41:07.229 --> 01:41:08.446
The troopers will be on our tail.

1266
01:41:08.522 --> 01:41:10.650
We have to be ready for that.

1267
01:41:10.733 --> 01:41:12.531
There's an access tunnel that leads...

1268
01:41:12.610 --> 01:41:15.159
Why are you doing that? Hmm?
Why are you doing this?

1269
01:41:15.237 --> 01:41:16.580
I'm trying to come up with a plan.

1270
01:41:33.297 --> 01:41:34.890
You all right?

1271
01:41:34.965 --> 01:41:36.592
- Yeah.
- Good.

1272
01:41:36.675 --> 01:41:38.268
What happened to you?
Did he hurt you?

1273
01:41:38.344 --> 01:41:39.721
Finn, what are you doing here?

1274
01:41:39.845 --> 01:41:41.939
We came back for you.

1275
01:41:42.807 --> 01:41:44.354
What'd he say?

1276
01:41:44.433 --> 01:41:45.810
That it was your idea.

1277
01:41:49.605 --> 01:41:50.697
Thank you.

1278
01:41:54.568 --> 01:41:56.161
How did you get away?

1279
01:41:56.237 --> 01:41:57.284
I can't explain it.

1280
01:41:57.363 --> 01:41:59.457
And you wouldn't believe it.

1281
01:41:59.532 --> 01:42:01.876
Escape now, hug later.

1282
01:42:17.049 --> 01:42:18.596
I got one behind me.

1283
01:42:18.717 --> 01:42:20.094
<i>- You see it?
- Yeah. I'm on it.</i>

1284
01:42:28.727 --> 01:42:30.570
- Burillo's been hit.
- Watch out for ground fire.

1285
01:42:35.484 --> 01:42:37.452
They're in trouble.

1286
01:42:37.528 --> 01:42:38.950
We can't leave.

1287
01:42:40.739 --> 01:42:43.743
My friend's got a bag full of explosives.

1288
01:42:43.826 --> 01:42:45.499
Let's use them.

1289
01:42:45.578 --> 01:42:46.955
General, are you seeing this?

1290
01:42:47.079 --> 01:42:48.422
Two more X-wings down.

1291
01:42:48.497 --> 01:42:50.875
That's half our fleet destroyed.

1292
01:42:50.958 --> 01:42:53.632
And their weapon
will be fully charged in ten minutes.

1293
01:42:53.711 --> 01:42:55.839
It would take a miracle to save us now.

1294
01:43:22.281 --> 01:43:23.282
Ah.

1295
01:43:23.365 --> 01:43:25.709
Girl knows her stuff.

1296
01:43:34.668 --> 01:43:37.137
We'll set the charges
against every other column.

1297
01:43:38.339 --> 01:43:40.307
You're right. That's a better idea.

1298
01:43:40.382 --> 01:43:42.384
You take the top. I'll go down below.

1299
01:43:42.468 --> 01:43:44.141
Detonator.

1300
01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:45.893
We'll meet back here.

1301
01:44:31.308 --> 01:44:32.309
<i>Find them.</i>

1302
01:45:34.079 --> 01:45:35.080
Ben!

1303
01:45:47.843 --> 01:45:48.969
Han Solo.

1304
01:45:49.678 --> 01:45:52.557
<i>I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.</i>

1305
01:46:11.825 --> 01:46:15.329
Take off that mask. You don't need it.

1306
01:46:15.913 --> 01:46:17.790
<i>What do you think you'll see if I do?</i>

1307
01:46:17.915 --> 01:46:20.168
The face of my son.

1308
01:46:42.022 --> 01:46:44.195
Your son is gone.

1309
01:46:45.484 --> 01:46:47.828
He was weak and foolish like his father.

1310
01:46:47.986 --> 01:46:49.738
So I destroyed him.

1311
01:46:51.824 --> 01:46:54.202
That's what Snoke wants you to believe.

1312
01:46:55.452 --> 01:46:57.170
But it's not true.

1313
01:46:58.497 --> 01:47:00.591
My son is alive.

1314
01:47:00.666 --> 01:47:02.134
No.

1315
01:47:02.209 --> 01:47:04.428
The Supreme Leader is wise.

1316
01:47:04.503 --> 01:47:07.256
Snoke is using you for your power.

1317
01:47:07.339 --> 01:47:09.137
When he gets what he wants,
he'll crush you.

1318
01:47:14.388 --> 01:47:16.061
You know it's true.

1319
01:47:21.687 --> 01:47:22.688
It's too late.

1320
01:47:22.771 --> 01:47:24.364
No, it's not.

1321
01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:26.192
Leave here with me. Come home.

1322
01:47:27.943 --> 01:47:29.365
We miss you.

1323
01:47:38.078 --> 01:47:40.206
I'm being torn apart.

1324
01:47:43.041 --> 01:47:45.214
I want to be free of this pain.

1325
01:47:50.632 --> 01:47:51.679
I know what I have to do...

1326
01:47:51.758 --> 01:47:53.886
but I don't know if I have
the strength to do it.

1327
01:47:57.806 --> 01:47:58.898
Will you help me?

1328
01:47:58.974 --> 01:48:00.817
Yes. Anything.

1329
01:48:49.107 --> 01:48:51.951
REYI No!

1330
01:48:58.867 --> 01:49:00.119
Thank you.

1331
01:49:07.626 --> 01:49:08.627
No.

1332
01:50:23.952 --> 01:50:25.545
The oscillator's been damaged...

1333
01:50:25.621 --> 01:50:27.373
but is still functional.

1334
01:50:27.456 --> 01:50:29.959
Admiral, their weapon
will fire in two minutes.

1335
01:50:41.219 --> 01:50:42.687
The Falcon's this way.

1336
01:51:03.575 --> 01:51:04.918
We're not done yet.

1337
01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:09.923
You're a monster.

1338
01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:11.917
It's just us now.

1339
01:51:13.085 --> 01:51:14.587
Han Solo can't save you.

1340
01:51:23.387 --> 01:51:25.185
Rey!

1341
01:51:27.974 --> 01:51:29.476
<i>REY -</i>

1342
01:51:29.559 --> 01:51:30.560
Rey!

1343
01:51:32.396 --> 01:51:34.023
Oh, no. No, no.

1344
01:51:34.106 --> 01:51:35.107
<i>REY -</i>

1345
01:51:37.317 --> 01:51:38.864
Traitor!

1346
01:51:49.413 --> 01:51:50.960
That lightsaber.

1347
01:51:52.082 --> 01:51:53.129
It belongs to me.

1348
01:51:53.208 --> 01:51:54.881
Come get it.

1349
01:53:42.692 --> 01:53:43.784
We just lost R-1.

1350
01:53:44.402 --> 01:53:45.699
<i>We're overwhelmed.</i>

1351
01:53:45.779 --> 01:53:47.076
What do we do? It isn't working.

1352
01:53:47.823 --> 01:53:50.042
Black Leader, there's a brand
new hole in that oscillator.

1353
01:53:51.076 --> 01:53:52.999
<i>Looks like our friends got in.</i>

1354
01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:55.497
Red Four, Red Six, cover us.

1355
01:53:55.580 --> 01:53:56.752
- I'm on it.
- Roger.

1356
01:53:56.832 --> 01:53:58.379
Everybody else, hit the target hard.

1357
01:53:58.458 --> 01:53:59.505
Give it everything you got.

1358
01:54:12.389 --> 01:54:13.766
I need some help here.
I need some help!

1359
01:54:13.849 --> 01:54:15.101
- Coming in!
- Watch out!

1360
01:54:16.309 --> 01:54:17.561
I'm hit!

1361
01:54:23.066 --> 01:54:24.989
All teams, I'm going in.

1362
01:54:25.110 --> 01:54:26.282
<i>Pull up and cover me.</i>

1363
01:54:26.361 --> 01:54:28.113
Copy that, Black Leader.
Good luck, Poe.

1364
01:54:34.244 --> 01:54:36.121
Weapon fully charged in 30 seconds.

1365
01:54:37.622 --> 01:54:38.794
Prepare to fire.

1366
01:56:11.883 --> 01:56:13.305
You need a teacher.

1367
01:56:15.178 --> 01:56:16.976
I could show you the ways of the Force.

1368
01:56:19.599 --> 01:56:20.691
The Force?

1369
01:58:09.459 --> 01:58:10.881
All eyes on that TIE fighter.

1370
01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:12.553
We're losing power rapidly!

1371
01:58:14.923 --> 01:58:16.846
Lieutenant!
Get back to your station!

1372
01:58:16.925 --> 01:58:20.225
Just look! We won't survive.
Even Hux is gone.

1373
01:58:20.345 --> 01:58:21.847
Supreme Leader.

1374
01:58:22.722 --> 01:58:24.690
The fuel cells have ruptured.

1375
01:58:24.766 --> 01:58:26.894
The collapse of the planet has begun.

1376
01:58:27.102 --> 01:58:31.152
Leave the base at once
and come to me with Kylo Ren.

1377
01:58:32.232 --> 01:58:34.109
It is time...

1378
01:58:34.192 --> 01:58:36.536
to complete his training.

1379
01:58:38.863 --> 01:58:39.864
Finn!

1380
01:58:40.615 --> 01:58:41.832
Finn.

1381
01:59:30.957 --> 01:59:34.052
- All teams, I got eyes on them.
- Yes!

1382
01:59:56.983 --> 02:00:00.112
Our job's done here. Let's go home.

1383
02:00:15.293 --> 02:00:17.637
Easy, easy. He's hurt.

1384
02:00:17.754 --> 02:00:18.971
We've got a heartbeat.

1385
02:01:21.025 --> 02:01:22.652
C-3POI R2-D2!

1386
02:01:23.528 --> 02:01:24.529
You've come back.

1387
02:01:28.491 --> 02:01:29.913
You found what?

1388
02:01:30.034 --> 02:01:32.036
How dare you call me that!

1389
02:01:34.414 --> 02:01:36.508
Find Master Luke, how?

1390
02:01:36.582 --> 02:01:37.629
Come, R2.

1391
02:01:37.709 --> 02:01:39.711
We must go tell the others at once!

1392
02:01:41.045 --> 02:01:42.137
General.

1393
02:01:42.213 --> 02:01:44.386
Excuse me, General.

1394
02:01:48.970 --> 02:01:51.473
R2 may contain some
much-needed good news.

1395
02:01:52.140 --> 02:01:53.608
Tell me.

1396
02:02:03.985 --> 02:02:05.407
Yeah. All right, buddy. Hold on.

1397
02:02:19.834 --> 02:02:21.461
The map, it is complete.

1398
02:02:22.086 --> 02:02:23.759
Luke.

1399
02:02:23.838 --> 02:02:25.431
Oh, my dear friend...

1400
02:02:25.548 --> 02:02:27.095
how I've missed you.

1401
02:02:44.067 --> 02:02:46.115
We'll see each other again.

1402
02:02:46.194 --> 02:02:48.117
I believe that.

1403
02:02:56.287 --> 02:02:58.085
Thank you, my friend.

1404
02:03:12.970 --> 02:03:14.813
Rey.

1405
02:03:16.474 --> 02:03:19.273
May the Force be with you.
